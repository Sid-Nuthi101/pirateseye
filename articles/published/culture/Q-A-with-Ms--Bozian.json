What subject did you teach over the years?"}, {"text": "I\u2019ve been a part of the Family and Consumer Sciences Department (formerly known as the Life Skills Department) for the last 36 years. My first two years, I taught one Foods class that consisted of first-year and advanced level students combined, along with eighth-grade cycle classes. Later, I continued to teach more classes for the department and an Independent Living class for Special Needs students."}, {"text": "When enrollment increased at South, I taught the same classes to the Severe Special Needs students known as the LARKS. Soon after, the Youth Teaching Youth (YTY) program became part of my department and I wrote the curriculum and began teaching that course for future educators in 1993-94."}, {"text": "Since then, I have mainly taught Child Growth and Development and YTY with a few years of Adaptive Life Skills\u2013until the LARKS program was moved to North\u2013and Culinary Arts."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "When did you first become a part of the South community? What were your first impressions?"}, {"text": "I began teaching at South in 1985 after teaching one year in a school for emotionally disturbed children in North Jersey. My first impressions were, \u201cNo walls, open space. Oh my goodness!\u201d\u00a0 Even in my area, the sound of the class next door was so distracting \u2014 as were the aromas of the food they were preparing."}, {"text": "The 600s area was the \u201cMiddle School\u201d \u2013 all classes for grades seven and eight were held there, except for science, which was taught in an area where the Media Center is currently located\u2013in the Pit!"}, {"text": "The demographics were very different from what they are now. Because of the proximity to Princeton and it being the mid-\u201980s, the students\u2019 dresses and mannerisms were very collegiate at that time \u2013 boys wore button-down collar shirts with ties and long plaid shorts and girls wore sweaters with pearls. It was very different from what I was used to."}, {"text": "The lockers in Commons One were painted yellow and in Commons Two and Three they were orange. All the students used their lockers and the 7th and 8th graders had theirs right outside my classrooms and wow, were they loud!"}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "What are some of your happiest memories at South \u2014 something you will\u00a0look back at and smile?"}, {"text": "There are so many. There was the Pirate Preschool, where over the years I watched my students interact with the children in such positive and life-changing ways for both the preschoolers and themselves. It was also a joy to spend time with my colleagues\u2019 delightful children and watch them grow!"}, {"text": "Another one of these memories was creating the YTY program and working closely with The Center for Future Educators at the College of New Jersey. Together we exposed South\u2019s interested students to the world of education through numerous opportunities and programs within the district and throughout the state. Witnessing one of my YTY students become the very first state president of the New Jersey Future Educators Association (NJFEA) and another student get voted by delegates from across the country to become president of the NJFEA were some of the proudest moments for me."}, {"text": "I had a lot of fun in the classroom, too. Years ago during a fire drill, we settled the Pirate preschool\u00a0 children on the grass in a circle to play \u201cDuck, Duck, Goose.\u201d Then, students from the 600 and 700 areas gathered around and joined the group, creating the largest \u201cDuck, Duck, Goose\u201d game I\u2019ve ever seen! Another day, we set the fire alarm off when having a barbeque activity with the LARKS on a rainy day. The borrowed grill was set up right outside an exterior door and the wind blew the smoke inside and off went the alarm on a rainy day!"}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "What hopes do you have for all these activities you participated in?"}, {"text": "I hope that the programs I put my heart and soul into over the years continue to flourish and grow.\u00a0 Developing them brought me great joy and satisfaction and witnessing the effect they had on my students, contributing to and enhancing their lives, will remain with me forever."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "What will you miss most about South?"}, {"text": "I think I will miss teaching and developing relationships with so many students, including those who never took one of my classes. I will also miss the faculty and staff \u2014 so much of my life has been spent in this building and with these wonderful individuals and so many are considered family to me."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "Reflecting back on your first year at South, how would you compare it to this year?"}, {"text": "This is very difficult to answer because of the pandemic, the Hybrid/Virtual learning situation and the effect they have had on education in general.\u00a0 This year is very different from my first-year experience but in some ways, it is also similar.\u00a0 Unlike my first year, this year I had to teach on a computer screen. Unlike my first year teaching Child Growth and Development, I could not give my students the opportunity to operate and participate in a preschool program and unlike my first year with the YTY program, this year the program had to be put on hold. But, similar to my first year, I needed to redesign and recreate learning activities to enhance, augment and reinforce the concepts in the curriculums."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "Do you have any messages for South students and staff?"}, {"text": "Never let go of that wonderful sense of family \u2013 the Pirate Family \u2013\u00a0 that exists at South.\u00a0 There is nothing more heartwarming than to know that you are part of a group where the professionals have such passion for what they do and the students have such an intense desire to learn and grow. The love and care for one another just flows throughout the building and I hope and pray that never ends."}, {"text": "Photo courtesy of Dawn Bozian."}], "file_structural_elements": {"title": "Q&A with Ms. Bozian", "date": "June 16, 2021", "writer": {"22LFbhDaaLDkiDFX4uv8": {"name": "Tanvi Singh", "year": "2020"}}, "description": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I interviewed retiring teacher Ms. Dawn Bozian.\u00a0 In the interview below, she speaks about her years teaching in WWPRSD and how South evolved to be the spirited community it is today.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What department were you a part of?
