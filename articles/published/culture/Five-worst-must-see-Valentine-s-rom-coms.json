But the overall premise of the movie had us all cringing. The usual dangerous, vampire boyfriend and the innocent, nerdy girlfriend combo is something we\u2019ve seen enough of in Vampire Diaries. Bella Swan said, \u201cDying in the place of someone I love seems like a good way to go.\u201d Not only is the dialogue cheesier than a Wisconsin school lunch but the scene filters are something that will haunt us forever."}, {"text": "Tall Girl"}, {"text": "With its highly charismatic cast, one would have thought that \u201cTall Girl\u201d would\u2019ve been one for the ages. But the method in which this film treats sensitive issues like bullying and body dysmorphia is infantile and ignorant. Sophomore Maya Patel said, \u201cThe plot was executed very poorly. It was illogical and I didn\u2019t like how Jodi had to change her personality to fit his expectations.\u201d"}, {"text": "To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before"}, {"text": "This movie definitely hits a little too close to home. The extent to which a person becomes obsessed with a crush is something many of us are probably too embarrassed to share. This movie, according to sophomore Mahek Upadhay, highlights \u201cwhat should have happened\u201d rather than \u201cwhat did happen.\u201d"}, {"text": "The DUFF"}, {"text": "In its rather successful attempt to reiterate social hierarchy in high school cliques, \u201cThe DUFF\u201d shows how even the closest friendships can be ripped apart with the right amount of gossip. A\u201cDUFF\u201d is an acronym for being a \u201cdesignated ugly fat friend.\u201d This movie highlights the dark side of being \u201cpopular\u201d and shows how it can take a strain on one\u2019s mental health. Freshman Rachel Joseph said, \u201cThe term \u201cDUFF\u201d sets a bad image and makes one question themselves of being a \u201cDUFF\u201d and creates \u201cunnecessary insecurities.\u201d"}, {"text": "The Kissing Booth"}, {"text": "The 2018 blockbuster Netflix film series \u201cThe Kissing Booth\u201d is something we\u2019ve all secretly watched as a guilty pleasure. With its over 25-year-old cast playing adolescent teenage roles, this movie sets the bar really high for pubescent pirates. In the film, boys are so tall they can\u2019t fit in a car and all the girls look like clones of Instagram models. It\u2019s an unrealistic image for all boys to be taller than six feet and for every girl to wear makeup and high heels everyday. Sophomore Samar Rahmani agrees, \u201cIt\u2019s so far off. They put so much effort into looking perfect and it made me feel pressured to put more effort in dressing up everyday.\u201d"}], "file_structural_elements": {"title": "Five worst must-see Valentine\u2019s rom-coms", "date": "February 14, 2022", "writer": {"arVyKy5gQKK0nVfft2Bk": {"name": "Deepa Srinidhi", "year": "2021"}}, "description": "Valentine\u2019s Day is here once again\u2013single and ready-to-mingle teenagers spend the most romantic day of the year on their couches with cheesy rom-coms and piles of homework.
