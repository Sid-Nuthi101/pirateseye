Dr. Amit Majmudar is a radiologist and a writer and he was Ohio\u2019s first Poet Laureate. During our\u00a0 Zoom panel discussion, which was open to sophomores at North and South, we spoke to Dr. Majmudar about his life as a physician and writer, his love for literature and negotiating identity labels. The following is an edited version of our panel discussion."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "What made you want to pursue both medicine and writing? Would you say that your two careers impact one another?"}, {"text": "For me, poetry and literature were the things I loved from a very early age. At the same time, both my parents and my sister were all doctors. It seemed to me that it was a noble profession: I wouldn\u2019t have to debase myself in pursuit of worldly success if I became a doctor. I pursued medicine to facilitate my first love which was literature. I chose to specialize in radiology knowing from the very beginning that I wanted to do two things at once. With radiology you have a shift, you do the shift and the rest of the hours of the day are yours. I also think that my life as a doctor really does impact my work as a writer. Becoming a doctor basically takes your 20s away. It\u2019s so formative and it\u2019s so much a part of my daily life that it finds its way into my writing even when I\u2019m not necessarily dedicating myself to writing about medicine."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "Since you\u2019ve had a love for literature from a young age, what kinds of literature did you encounter in your early education? What about high school, specifically?"}, {"text": "I did spend some time early on reading a lot of Newbery Award-winning books and I remember my favorite was Johnny Tremain. In elementary school and middle school, I started getting into science fiction, like Issac Asimov. Then I started getting into spy fiction, Ian Flemming\u2019s James Bond novels and a lot of other thrillers that were generally written for grownups\u2013even in high school I was really into those. Then, I blundered into old literature like the \u201cCanterbury Tales\u201d by Chaucer, or Dante\u2019s \u201cInferno,\u201d or the \u201cIliad\u201d and the \u201cOdyssey.\u201d I don\u2019t think I necessarily understood it to the full and I certainly didn\u2019t understand it as much as I understand it now, but the good thing about those books is that they reward rereading. I\u2019ve since revisited a lot of those books and I\u2019ve gotten more out of them as someone who is older. But I would never trade those early reading experiences for anything because it really introduced me to the western tradition.\u00a0 I was also introduced to the Indian tradition and to a bunch of different literary traditions around the world. I was just really really into it."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "Both in terms of the growing demographic of Asian Americans, especially in our district and in terms of this thread of common humanity that you can find in all stories, do you feel that it\u2019s important for young people to read diverse texts?"}, {"text": "Yeah, absolutely. I think that\u2019s one of the best ways you can understand the humanity of people around you. As you go out into the world you\u2019re going to come across people from all different backgrounds and it\u2019s important for us not to get provincial and open our minds. This holds true both for people engaging with our culture and for us when we engage with other people\u2019s cultures. One of the best ways we can do that is through literature because this is where people tell their stories. This is where people embody their hopes and aspirations, their dreams and their despair, the good and the bad of their stories. And once you really hear someone\u2019s story out, you can never find yourself in a place where you\u2019re feeling alienated from that person, or feeling negativity towards that person. It\u2019s a civic duty in a sense. It\u2019s interesting to meet people through literature \u2013 meet writers and also their characters \u2013 through literature. Whether that\u2019s your contemporaries from other walks of life and other cultural backgrounds, or whether you\u2019re doing that in time \u2013 using literature as a form of time travel to see what people were like here, there, or anywhere. That\u2019s all illuminating and it broadens us and deepens us."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "Some sophomores may recognize Dr. Majmudar\u2019s poem, \u201cDothead,\u201d from their LA II Honors class.

That\u2019s where the poem ends \u2013 it begins in a high school cafeteria in the late 1980s. It\u2019s called \u201cDothead,\u201d which was a racial slur that was referring to the bindi, as I\u2019m sure you all know."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "How has your upbringing influenced the themes that you\u2019ve written about in your works and specifically in \u201cDothead\u201d?"}, {"text": "This is probably one of the poems that I\u2019ve written that is most drawn from my personal experience growing up in suburban Ohio. I have this culture and background that is very dear to me and it is a question of how does this get represented in a classroom format when they are talking about all the ways Indians are seen as weird or horrible. Is that really representative of how I lived in that background? There was this disconnect for me where they were supposedly talking about my civilization and my background but it didn\u2019t track to anything I had lived or read. That aspect plays into the poem. There is also an aspect of regret. The narrator starts by saying a measured, deep, poised and controlled thing that he wishes he would have said and that\u2019s how the poem opens\u2013with the narrator wishing he had those words ready. Then, it becomes another fantasy of not being poised and explanatory and trying to deepen the conversation. It becomes aggressive and he invokes the god of destruction. There was this sudden desire to be conciliatory that gives away to not wanting to be conciliatory and wanting to assert one\u2019s heritage."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "The bindi is a prominent part of your poem. Why did you choose a bindi to represent the culture in this poem?"}, {"text": "There are a couple of reasons. One is because in the 70s and 80s, the racists who invented the slur \u201cdothead,\u201d chose the bindi to represent our culture. In a sense, it\u2019s a response to the bindi being the identifiable marker of otherness. There is also a profound spiritual meaning of the third eye of lord Shiva, who in turn, becomes the god formed at the end of time:\u00a0 Nataraja the dancer. Nataraja that I mentioned in the final line of the poem is a manifestation of Shiva and Shiva is the one who has the third eye, which relates to the bindi. There is that network of mythology, the history and the personal experience all coming together into one poem or network of associations. I think from the beginning of the poem, it is a matter of \u201cI\u2019m a little bit ashamed of it; I\u2019m going to explain it to you and I don\u2019t want you to think that it is so weird.\u201d By the end of the poem, it becomes the planet Mars, the bringer of war, or the third eye blazing forth aesthetic energy. It becomes something that the narrator is ashamed of a little bit or something he wants to explain away. But then, the narrator becomes proud and fearless."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "Do you often find that you\u2019re labeled as an immigrant writer? What\u2019s your opinion on labels such as \u201cAsian writer,\u201d \u201cMidwestern writer,\u201d or even \u201cmale writer\u201d that authors are often classified as?"}, {"text": "I do feel that I am labeled as that pretty frequently. I think \u201cdoctor writer\u201d is another one that I get a lot. It doesn\u2019t bother me much because I know that people are trying to get a handle on a writer. Critics like to do this, book reviewers like to do this, booksellers like to do it, publishers like to do it and readers like to do it. It allows them to mentally classify people and create a broad category, such as, like you said, male writer. That\u2019s a very big category and all sorts of things can fit it. If it gets really reductionistic that can get straightjacket-like where they\u2019re like this is an Indian American doctor writer from the Midwest of Hindu origin. You\u2019re bringing it down to a narrow thing and there\u2019s a lot to me that isn\u2019t going to be covered by that narrow category. I think that if I, as a minority, or as an Indian American, write about certain topics it\u2019ll be perceived to be more authoritative if it directly relates to my identity. I don\u2019t necessarily feel that pressure, but I know that dynamic exists. It exists in people\u2019s heads and it\u2019s not something that I can change. I tend to focus on things I can control, which are the words on the page. All I can do is try and show all those people that label us, who try to reduce us through those labels that there\u2019s more to us than just that particular element and that there\u2019s a lot more to everybody than just any given identity-based element that they apply to us."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "Can you talk about your writing process?\u00a0 What are some solutions you have when you have difficulty developing your thoughts?\u00a0 What about writer\u2019s block?"}, {"text": "My technique is to just sit down and write it. I feel that I don\u2019t have to show my failures to anyone. If something doesn\u2019t work, then no one has to see it. That really frees me up from writer\u2019s block because a lot of it has to do with your internal critic getting the upper hand over your internal creator. I\u2019m in my study, in this exact room, at this exact laptop and I just let her rip. I just get things down and if I have to discard it, I\u2019ll discard it."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "At the end of our panel discussion, Dr. Majmudar read the poem \u201cVocative\u201d from his most recent poetry collection, \u201cWhat He Did in Solitary.\u201d"}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "\u201cVocative\u201d from \u201cWhat He Did in Solitary\u201d reprinted with permission from Amit Majmudar"}, {"text": "English is my native"}, {"text": "anguish.
