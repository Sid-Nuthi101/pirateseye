According to the Harris Poll, one of the longest running U.S. public surveys, only about 30 percent of Americans are happy. The causes of unhappiness vary from personal, national, or global issues. Although there is no magical cure to make people happier, there is one concept that can help: gratitude."}, {"text": "The word gratitude comes from the Latin word \u201cgratus,\u201d which means pleasing or thankful. Gratitude is the state of being grateful and showing appreciation. The practice of recognizing what one is grateful for is proving to be a key factor in benefiting people\u2019s mental health, happiness and overall quality of life.\n\u201cExpressing gratitude always makes me feel good, even if it\u2019s in a small way,\u201d said senior Lea Martin."}, {"text": "One recent study performed by psychologists at the University of Miami showed that writing down what you\u2019re grateful for greatly improves mental health and mood. After just ten weeks, the results showed that the participants felt more optimistic."}, {"text": "These positive feelings that arise after expressing gratitude is not just a coincidence. A person\u2019s brain activity chemically changes when they express gratitude. The Greater Good Science Center at The University of California, Berkeley tested this by measuring brain activity with an fMRI scanner when subjects were engaged in small acts of gratitude. Their brain activity showed that felt happier and their mental health improved."}, {"text": "In addition, similar to mindfulness and meditation, gratitude proves to be an effective stress reliever."}, {"text": "Most students at South have practiced meditation in health classes, Unconferences, clubs or even on their own as an outlet to relieve stress. Gratitude has proven to be just as effective and is also practical for busy students. Meditation requires time taken out of your day to sit and be mindful, but expressing gratitude can be done in a matter of seconds, and is proven to be just as constructive."}, {"text": "It is very easy in today\u2019s society to forget how to be grateful. Not only does social media have a direct link to people\u2019s unhappiness, but social media also hurts people\u2019s ability to express gratitude.\nSocial media users get wrapped up in looking at altered realities of other people\u2019s lives since most of it only shows the parts of their lives they want the public to see. It is easy for people to get jealous and upset that their own life doesn\u2019t live up to the ones they see on their screens. Jealousy causes people to become ungrateful about what they have in their own lives. This is why it\u2019s more important to regularly practice gratitude now more than ever before."}, {"text": "Fitting gratitude into everyday life is simple.

It\u2019s a good way to get perspective,\u201d said senior Phoebe Elias."}, {"text": "Another method is taking a minute at the end of the day to write down things people are grateful for that day. This simple task of jotting down a few words and expressions of gratitude is a great way to practice mindfulness. Keeping a gratitude journal is an easy way for people to organize their thoughts and even look back on previous days and remind themselves of what they\u2019re grateful for."}, {"text": "This is seen in Ms Hayden\u2019s junior health classes, where her students write in gratitude journals every day. \u201cSo far (the gratitude journals) have been pretty helpful for me,\u201d said junior Raagavi Venkatesh. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard to think of things every day, but I have realized that even the smallest things count.\u201d"}, {"text": "It\u2019s important for people to start practicing gratitude now because it is the future source of our happiness.
