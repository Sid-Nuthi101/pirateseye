Thirteen years after escaping the Ten Rings, Shang-Chi is taken back to their base of operations as his father reveals his plan to invade his late wife\u2019s native village, Ta Lo.

After the death of Wenwu\u2019s wife, Shang-Chi\u2019s family became fractured because his father distanced himself from his children, rebuilding the Ten Rings\u2019 power and forcing Shang-Chi to undergo traumatic assassin training during his childhood."}, {"text": "Having struggled with this childhood trauma, Shang-Chi longs for reconciliation. Before his father is consumed by the evil entity, he appealed to Wenwu to accept the past, allowing him to accept Shang-Chi as a true son again.

This characterization attempts to correct the racialized representations of the previous century. Given the underrepresentation of Asian characters in the movie industry, American audiences are seeing for the first time a powerful lead character and cast on the big screen playing natural, relatable people and showing us the diversity of our country."}, {"text": "\u201cIn this movie, they all represent a small piece of the Asian and Asian-American experience,\u201d Chinese language teacher Vivian Yu said. \u201cIt was beyond my expectations, and I was stunned.
