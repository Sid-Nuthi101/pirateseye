The recipe calls for raisins but since tastes differ in my family, I generally make one with raisins and one without raisins.\u00a0 Personally, the raisins are a must and they add a little sweetness to the sugarless dough.\u00a0 Recently, in my genealogical research, I discovered that my husband\u2019s second great-grandfather immigrated from the county of Londonderry, in Northern Ireland. I can\u2019t say for sure if his ancestors made Irish soda bread as we know it today, but certainly, they made bread to feed their families.\u00a0 Every culture prepares some sort of dough to bake and share with those at the table. For me, making Irish soda bread is a great reminder to me that as humans we are more alike than different because there is a wonderful joy in sharing bread together with family and friends.\u201d"}, {"text": "Mrs. Kathryn Carroll"}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "This St. Patrick\u2019s Day, make Irish Soda Bread, a traditional Irish recipe, passed down from generations that created an everlasting legacy."}, {"text": "The recipe can be found below, provided by Mrs. Carroll."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "Irish Soda Bread"}, {"text": "Ingredients"}, {"text": "Directions"}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "Or try a minier recipe of Irish Soda Bread, supplied by Culinary Arts Teacher Ms. Jessica Bidwell!
