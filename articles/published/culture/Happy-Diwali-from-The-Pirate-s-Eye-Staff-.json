I also help my mom make a bunch of sweets and food to present to God. On the day of Deepavali, my Mom wakes up early in the morning to make rangoli and wash all of the mandir items.\nDiwali is my favorite Indian holiday because it is filled with so much color and is a day to celebrate and spend more time with family and friends. We also call all of our relatives and wish them good health, prosperity, and peace. On this day I feel more connected to my culture and it puts a smile on my face.\nUsually during Deepavali my family invites many family friends to celebrate. Obviously, due to the coronavirus pandemic, many things have changed. But a few of my family friends and I will get together and light firecrackers in our neighborhood to celebrate the festival of lights."}, {"text": "The day before Diwali, my mom spends hours making a variety of sweets and foods. For as long as I can remember, ever since I was a little kid, as my mom would place one sweet after another on a dish, I would pick one up and stuff it in my mouth, hoping she wouldn\u2019t notice. While I was busy eating up sweets made for guests, my dad and sister would put up colorful fairy lights all around the house, lighting up the whole place.\nA couple of hours before our guests arrived, we\u2019d make designs made of a white paste called rangoli around the house. We would place two diyas on either side of every door in the house. All the candles around the house make me feel safe and warm.\u00a0 Diwali brings me closer to my family.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Diwali won\u2019t be the same. On this special day, we usually welcome many guests as a way to show our appreciation and love, but this year, we are only able to invite a couple of people over. This day is a day for positivity, so it is important to cherish and be thankful for the people we are able to spend time with."}, {"text": "My cousin sister and I usually spend the day of Diwali decorating our house.

This year, we\u2019re planning on celebrating by making little decorations that symbolize our culture."}, {"text": "Diwali will definitely be a little bit different this year because we cannot invite other family over.

We won\u2019t be able to celebrate it with my grandma or meet up with friends and family to exchange wishes. But, technology comes to the rescue. My parents will probably video chat with relatives.
