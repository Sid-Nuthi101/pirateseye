According to the Asian Pacific American Heritage Month website, Jew noticed a lack of recognition of Asian American and Pacific Islander history and approached Representative Frank Horton. Rep. Horton, from New York, drafted a resolution, which took two tries to pass but was eventually recognized by the House, Senate and President Jimmy Carter. The resolution proclaimed that the 10 days following May 4 would be reserved for all Americans to celebrate Asian American and Pacific Islander history. Later, in 1992, Congress declared an annual month-long celebration of Asian American and Pacific Islander history."}, {"text": "May was chosen because in May 1868, the first Japanese immigrants came to the United States.

I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s heritage and not history. There\u2019s a lot of connotations that come with the word heritage.
