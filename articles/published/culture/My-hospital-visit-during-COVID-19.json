After growing concerned, my father contacted my orthopaedic surgeon at the Alfred I DuPont Children\u2019s Hospital, Wilmington, Delaware where I\u2019ve been receiving treatment for my orthopaedic conditions. A few weeks after the start of school, my surgeon informed my father and me that I needed spine surgery. To ensure the safety of others in the hospital, I was required to test for COVID-19 the day before my surgery. The test could be either the pharyngeal test (where the throat is swabbed) or the nasopharyngeal test (where the nose and throat are swabbed), which some prefer because it has a higher rate of accuracy. I had a pharyngeal test. If I tested positive, my surgery would be delayed by three weeks. Thankfully, I was negative."}, {"text": "After my father and I took the elevator and walked into the main atrium where the welcome desk was located, we saw purple, circular signs on the floor telling people to stay six feet apart. A portable guardrail was installed to keep people apart. When we got up to the front desk, a woman took our temperature using an infrared thermometer. Across the hospital, there were signs that explained which face coverings will and will not protect against COVID-19."}, {"text": "After the doctors and nurses prepared me for my surgery, I was sedated and taken to an operating room. A few hours later after the surgery, I was escorted to my room. As usual, the first night after surgery was a lot of heavy monitoring.

Once a day, the cleaning staff came in and sanitized my room."}, {"text": "Because of the pandemic, the hospital had made additional adjustments to ensure the safety of staff and patients. \u201cWe weren\u2019t doing optional surgeries at the height of the pandemic,\u201d said Colleen Ditro, a nurse practitioner at Alfred I DuPont Children\u2019s Hospital.\u00a0 \u201cOnly emergency surgeries.

According to general surgeon Dr. Kirk Reichard in a video posted by the hospital, \u201cTo keep our families safe, we start by doing regular deep cleans of all our patient care spaces and waiting rooms.
