The South community has found new ways to adapt well-loved traditions, like Homecoming and Halloween. Students and teachers are adjusting to the changes and technological challenges, simultaneously trying to maintain a sense of normalcy in the middle of a pandemic. Teachers in particular are facing unique challenges and are working hard to ensure that students\u2019 quality of education are not compromised.

International Business and Culture and American Studies teacher, Brad Borsuk, is one of the teachers who feels that this has impacted his teaching experience. His favorite aspects about teaching, like socializing and creating bonds with his students, have become less attainable. Mr. Borsuk said, \u201cIt is much harder to know students, because there isn\u2019t a chance of seeing kids interact with each other, and there isn\u2019t an opportunity to just walk around and start up random conversations.\u201d"}, {"text": "Geometry and Precalculus teacher, Jeannine Yorke, agreed. \u201cFor as much as we try to build a connection with them virtually, I feel as though I can foster a much stronger student-teacher relationship while having them present in class.\u00a0 I miss the noise, the interactions, the participation (that is not just typing in the chat) and seeing the excitement on their faces when a concept that they\u2019ve been struggling with \u2018clicks.\u2019\u201d"}, {"text": "Despite these challenges, teachers are working hard to maintain an effective learning environment for students."}, {"text": "\u201cStudents should know that teachers were not trained to do this, but we have taken initiative to learn how to do our best during this time,\u201d Concert Band teacher Jesse Argenziano said. \u201cIntegrity is very important for all of us and teachers are here to help show you how to survive in today\u2019s world.\u201d"}, {"text": "Mr. Coburn agrees that students and teachers should strive to understand each other. \u201cTeachers have been teaching for a long time and put a ton of effort into their lessons.
