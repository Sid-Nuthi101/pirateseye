My childhood dream was to become a world famous detective like Nancy Drew."}, {"text": "After almost 90 years since its publication, the story has been adapted for the big screen. The movie,\u201cNancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase\u201d takes a modern approach to Nancy\u2019s character. Sophia Lillis, famous for her acting in the 2017 movie \u201cIt,\u201d plays the role of 16-year-old Nancy."}, {"text": "The movie was released mid-March and brought back nostalgic memories for many. Unfortunately, rather than improving the story, the on-screen Nancy loses her original charm and vivacity."}, {"text": "The movie starts with a scene of Nancy Drew skateboarding down the streets of her suburban hometown, River Heights. Nancy and her two best friends, Bess and George, get together to talk. When Nancy hears that Bess is being bullied by a school jock, she rigs a showerhead in the boys\u2019 locker room. But this is not true to the Nancy of the novel. \u00a0The original Nancy would have done the right thing and talked it out with the school jock instead of pulling a cruel prank."}, {"text": "As punishment for her prank, the Sheriff tasks her with community service. Nancy is to help an eccentric, elderly woman Flora, who lives in a mansion that Flora believes is haunted."}, {"text": "Nancy, with a brain for puzzles and games, gets intrigued and starts investigating. After poking around, she finds a secret lever in Flora\u2019s bookcase that reveals a hidden staircase."}, {"text": "One key difference between the book and the movie is that Nancy is portrayed as more of an everyday teenager \u2014 pulling pranks, getting caught and even being sentenced to community service."}, {"text": "This is different from the books where Nancy was seen as an exceptionally good student who never got into trouble at school. This change was made to interest today\u2019s teenagers, who enjoy movies with strong, rebellious main characters."}, {"text": "\u201c[The movie] was really good with the plot and all but I feel like it took away from the book series,\u201d sophomore Vonesha Shaik said. \u201cThey were like two whole different things and I didn\u2019t really like that.\u201d"}, {"text": "People have strong opinions of what medium is better: book or movie.

Important characters in the books were left out of the movies. Unfortunately, this was exactly the issue with the new Nancy Drew movie. The movie did not match up with the books."}, {"text": "While it may not be relatable to this generation because of the changes in mindset towards women, the innocent, determined character of Nancy from the 1930 book was the reason I admired her for her strength. During a decade where women were expected to be docile and submissive, the voice of a young female teenager pursuing her dream and standing up against all odds was a breath of fresh air."}, {"text": "The movie made the original story relevant to today\u2019s teenagers, but the onscreen version of Nancy lacks the wit and charm of the original."}, {"text": "My recommendation? \u00a0Read the book."}], "file_structural_elements": {"title": "\u201cNancy Drew and The Hidden Staircase:\u201d far cry from the original", "date": "May 21, 2019", "writer": {"AXvzZ0PQFIFcXDXWC3U8": {"name": "Priyanka Chakrabarti", "year": "2020"}}, "description": " \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raindrops patter against your window.
