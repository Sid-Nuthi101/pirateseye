According to the New York Times, Harvard consistently rates Asian American applicants lower on traits such as likability, kindness, courage etc. The prosecutors argue that this allows the university to hold Asian-Americans to a higher standard without it seeming like bias. Furthermore, this personal rating is one of the biggest factors that Harvard considers during admissions decisions."}, {"text": "Senior Ayesha Gupta said, \u201cWhile Harvard is trying to create a diverse campus, they shouldn\u2019t automatically consider traits such as personality lower for Asian Americans.\u201d"}, {"text": "Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act bars discrimination at private institutions that receive federal funds and this is what the prosecuting group is resting its case on."}, {"text": "The judge presiding over this case is Judge Allison D.

Bakke. The Supreme Court ruled that universities were not allowed to set race-based quotas but could use affirmative action to increase the number of minority students at their school. Affirmative action is a government based action to reduce discrimination and increase diversity which encourages having goals. Race based quotas are specific numbers that universities must hit which separates applicants into their ethnic group."}, {"text": "The Trump Administration is siding with the Students for Fair Action.

He first implemented this law as a way to address the persistent discrimination that had occurred even after the long history of the Civil Rights Movement. However, they were not enforced strictly during his time and so the laws were really only to show that progress was occurring even if in practice it wasn\u2019t."}, {"text": "But President Lyndon B.
