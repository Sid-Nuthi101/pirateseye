TikTok describes itself as \u201c[t]he destination for mobile videos.\u201d The New York Times refers to it as \u201c[a]n app for making and sharing short videos.\u201d In other words, TikTok is another social media platform created for teens\u2019 entertainment purposes."}, {"text": "The app was developed by the China-based Internet technology company ByteDance in 2016. The app didn\u2019t reach popularity until it was launched in the international market in 2017. By the time summer 2019 hit, I couldn\u2019t go anywhere without hearing about TikTok."}, {"text": "The newfound popularity of TikTok is understandable considering its many appeals, one of them being how easy it is to use. When a user opens the app it takes them directly to the \u201cFor you\u201d page, which is essentially a bottomless pit for all TikTok videos ever made. The concept of just scrolling up to the next video and double tapping to like it is very effective. People find it much easier to use compared to other social media apps. \u201cI find TikTok so much more accessible than Twitter,\u201d said senior Phoebe Elias, \u201cTikTok is very easy to follow and that\u2019s why I think so many people enjoy it.\u201d"}, {"text": "Another quality that appeals to many users is the ease in gaining a following and becoming \u201cinternet famous\u201d compared to other social media apps. TikTok works on an algorithm that runs on trending hashtags."}, {"text": "Anyone can get on the \u201cFor You\u201d page by simply posting their video with a #foryoupage underneath of it. Users will see the videos on their page and will have the option to like it, just scroll past or swipe right to view the user\u2019s profile. The more frequent a user posts, the better chances they have to get on the \u201cFor You\u201d page, get more likes and gain a following."}, {"text": "Possibly the best part about TikTok, though, is the fun trends that it creates for teens. These trends quickly take the internet by storm. Whether it\u2019s a new dance fad, lip-synching to a popular song or a relatable short comedy skit, TikTok has it all."}, {"text": "Teens especially enjoy the new trends and creating videos with their friends. \u201cI love making TikToks with my friends. No one even sees them except for us. It\u2019s just fun to laugh about them,\u201d said Elias.\nDespite all of these unique and trendy features of the app, it has its critics. \u201cTikTok is not exactly adding anything new to the social media world,\u201d said senior Meghan Krabbe."}, {"text": "Critics aside, TikTok has many fans. A recent New York Times article referred to the app as, \u201ca refreshing outlier in the social media universe.\u201d"}, {"text": "It\u2019s a great place to go if you\u2019re looking for some light hearted fun and some laughs."}], "file_structural_elements": {"title": "New app TikTok becomes internet\u2019s latest sensation", "date": "November 1, 2019", "writer": {"": {"name": "Alyse Dunn", "year": ""}}, "description": "\u201cHow do you not know what TikTok is?\u201d I hear students asking in the hallways of South.
