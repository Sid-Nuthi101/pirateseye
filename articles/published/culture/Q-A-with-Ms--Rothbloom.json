What were your first impressions?"}, {"text": "I joined South in 1987 when I took over for maternity leave.

The school was the only high school in the district and the 500 area was composed of trailers. The school had 7th-12th grades. The township was primarily an agrarian one and coming from NY, I had to get used to the open space concept."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "Were there any South activities that you liked partaking in? What hopes do you have for them?"}, {"text": "Spirit Week, watching the kids at prom, walking at graduation and saying goodbye to my students, the teacher potluck luncheons, Washington Seminar, Gettysburg and Constitutional Center trips, everything. My first hope is that the South traditions will continue and South will continue to participate in those diversity/equity discussions. My second hope is that Fall 2021 will be a return to the school we all know and love, with everyone back. My final hope is that although South will be even bigger, that it maintains that personal touch with each and every person."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "Do you have any messages for South students and staff?"}, {"text": "I will miss them all but I will NOT miss Zooming!
