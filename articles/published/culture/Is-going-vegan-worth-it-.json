Veganism is a form of vegetarianism. In addition to a vegetarian diet, vegans do not eat animal products. Today, celebrities like Benedict Cumberbatch, Ariana Grande, Liam Hemsworth and Natalie Portman advocate for this type of diet. Although some people follow this diet due to health conditions, like food allergies to meat and dairy, the most common reason behind veganism\u2019s popularity is taking a stance against animal abuse."}, {"text": "According to the 2020 U.S. Animal Kill Clock, a database that presents data about animal abuse, approximately 5 billion animals have been killed for food production this year. Many of these animals are stuffed into small cages, neglected and abused until they die."}, {"text": "Veal is an example of this type of mistreatment. According to an expos\u00e9 by the animal rights organization Mercy for Animals explains how male calves are taken from their mother, so the animal farmers can obtain milk from the female cows."}, {"text": "The male calves are then rammed into tiny cages in a stable because they are not seen as profitable. This restricts the calves\u2019 movement and impedes the development of their muscles, which is why veal is much more tender than normal beef."}, {"text": "After stumbling upon truths like this about how animals pay the cost for our pleasure, many people stopped eating meat. One example is French teacher Patrick Hartmann, who started out as a vegetarian and turned vegan 15 years ago."}, {"text": "\u201cI went vegetarian after I was driving home with my family from Mississippi,\u201d said Mr. Hartmann. \u201cWe were on the highway and I passed a truck full of baby pigs and I was just like \u2018Where are they going? What are they doing?\u2019 and I looked at the truck guy\u2019s license plate and it said \u2018eat meat\u2019.\u201d The bumper sticker said it all."}, {"text": "\u201cI wanted to be more ethically sound and more responsible and I didn\u2019t think being vegetarian was enough,\u201d Mr.Hartman said. \u201cThe reason why I am an ethical vegan is because I\u2019ve done my research: I have watched videos and I know how the animals are treated.\u201d"}, {"text": "I, too, was shocked when I watched these expos\u00e9s. I experimented with going vegan. This meant no cheese, butter, meat, milk or honey for a week."}, {"text": "As a person who has never lived without dairy products, I could not leave them out of my diet entirely. So I bought the Kite Hill almond milk cream cheese spread for $6.49 to put on my bagels."}, {"text": "I was not a big fan of it. The taste resembled cream cheese, but the texture was off-putting: it felt like rubber in my mouth and despite the interesting nutty flavor. I gave up on trying to find substitutes and instead focused on what I could eat a lot of: fruits and vegetables."}, {"text": "Usually, I snack on a lot of cookies and brownies, but during my week of going vegan, I cut down on snacking altogether ."}, {"text": "Due to this change, I felt fatigued at the start of the week.

You aren\u2019t getting all the nutrients and it\u2019s just very inconvenient.\u201d\nContrary to this common belief, a vegan diet can provide adequate nutrients. According to familydoctor.org, run by the American Academy of Family Physicians, this diet provides a surplus of protein, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12\u2013three nutrients that are commonly believed to not be provided by a vegan diet. Flaxseed meal and oil are two sources of omega-3 fatty acids.
