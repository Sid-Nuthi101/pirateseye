What were your first impressions?"}, {"text": "I came to South five years ago. I had been at North for a few years in a part-time capacity as a Media Specialist. Here, I was immediately taken with the Pirate spirit and sense of community. Often, words and phrases like \u201cspirit\u201d or \u201csense of community\u201d are thrown out as platitudes in an attempt to describe a feeling or a place, but at South these words carry weight. I felt immediately at home and felt lucky to come to work every day in such a special place. The staff were all very welcoming, and the students were incredibly polite and respectful. Of course, there were challenges, but in general, I have felt that students and staff alike enjoy being a part of something that feels like family, something larger than themselves."}, {"text": "I was fortunate also to follow in the footsteps of the two long time and well-loved librarians who came before me, Randye McBride and Deborah Marinsky. I wished I had managed to leave behind some kind of a memoriam to them; they were at South for a long time and established many of the library procedures and practices that are still in evidence and that help to make the library what it is. I also appreciate the book collection that they left, so that even if I have not been able to update it much and have been busy weeding older materials, the core collection is one they developed, and I only wish more materials were circulated. I tend to tell people that some of the oldest books in the collection are some of the best. Books do become dated, but some of the oldest have held their value over time."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "What are some of your happiest memories at South \u2014 something you will\u00a0look back at and smile?"}, {"text": "I worked closely with two library aides during my years at South, Mrs. Nikolaeva and Mrs. Khot. Any regulars at the library will have seen them behind the circulation desk. The three of us worked together and coordinated efforts with our student library department aides, and over the years we had regular lunchtime business meetings/parties and formed a close-knit group. We had lots of fun and laughs \u2013\u00a0 and our aides collectively have contributed in so many ways of which I\u2019m certain the school community is not fully aware."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "What will you miss most about South?"}, {"text": "I\u2019ll miss the students, the staff, and the administration, all who contributed to that special South spirit. I\u2019ll miss seeing not only the library aides and helpers but the \u201cregulars\u201d in the library be they students or staff. I\u2019ll also miss the special occasions, such as Halloween and Homecoming, and other school events, such as the fall drama and spirit week."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "Is there something you have learned from your experience at South that you would\u00a0like to share?"}, {"text": "I\u2019ve learned that being in an atmosphere of positivity and goodwill goes a long way; I have encountered this generosity of spirit time and again, and I want to take this with me. My wish is that everyone connected with South carries some of this out into the world, especially in this time of uncertainty and for many real hardships."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "Reflecting back on your first year at South, how would you compare it to this year?"}, {"text": "The first year there was definitely a learning curve in taking over the management of the library, those first few months especially. This year, though, was especially challenging. Before the lockdown, there was planning for eventual construction, so unneeded equipment and books needed to be weeded, and a lot was accomplished with regard to these efforts. However, with the lockdown and all the uncertainty plus the challenges of online learning, it\u2019s been more difficult, although I\u2019ve learned a lot, as we all have, with this new reality."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "You have supported South\u2019s unofficial book club since its beginning. Do you have any hopes or wishes for the club?"}, {"text": "I have been privileged to support and participate in South\u2019s unofficial book club for the past two years, and I am happy to say that two rising seniors will be taking charge next year: Suneha Sinha Ray and Chacrica Pagadala. I hope that the club will grow and that perhaps the club may become official. Book Clubs at South have come and gone, I understand, but I hope that it will become a fixture in the school. Reading is so important, and just having the club is one way to highlight the importance of leisure reading. There are so many benefits, and I feel that the majority of students don\u2019t give reading its due. Since school became virtual, the Book Club did as well, and we have continued to read and discuss books together."}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "Do you have any message for South students and staff?"}, {"text": "Please support the library in any way you can think of; be appreciative, come to the library and use its resources. With budgetary challenges, libraries everywhere, be they school or public or academic, libraries and their resources are at risk, and they get by with very little.
