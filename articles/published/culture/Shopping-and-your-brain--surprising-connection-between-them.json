Senior Lily Zhu explained, \u201cI prefer online shopping compared to shopping at a mall just because it\u2019s less tiring.\u201d"}, {"text": "One of the exciting parts of online shopping is waiting for the package, containing everything you ordered with clicks of your finger, outside your door.

If someone already owns a brand that they like, they\u2019re more likely to feel positive about the purchase."}, {"text": "Although shopping can be beneficial for the brain, it\u2019s not all positive.
