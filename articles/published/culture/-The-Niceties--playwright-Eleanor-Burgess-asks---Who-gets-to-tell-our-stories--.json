An example Burgess gives is the reference to \u2018peccavi\u2019 in \u201cThe Niceties.\u201d In the play, Janine references Indian colonial history. In 1843, General Charles James Napier conquered a province called Sindh in northwestern India and sent back a telegraph to the government in England with a single word: \u201cPeccavi.\u201d This is Latin for \u201cI have sinned,\u201d a pun that Jeanine explains to Zoe while chuckling."}, {"text": "However, Burgess said, \u201c[T]he funny thing about this story is that this story is incorrect. It never happened. That story of peccavi originated as a joke in a British humor magazine, Punch.\u201d"}, {"text": "The truth of this story has been so muddled it is now written in textbooks and is believed to be an actual historical event. Burgess added, \u201cSo you can read a textbook and believe it\u2019s true. But it\u2019s not. So it\u2019s part of that theme in the play of what is true. How do you know?
