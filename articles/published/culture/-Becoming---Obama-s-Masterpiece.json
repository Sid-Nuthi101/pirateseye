Her book tour has the same feel as her novel- she manages to make her presence as a national figure feel like an intimate meeting.

While memoirs are often too sentimental for me, Obama\u2019s contained many laugh-out-loud moments, such as her irritation at Barack Obama when he showed up late for his first day as an intern at her law firm or her horrified reaction when she found out he smoked. She also discussed life lessons, such as when she learned about living life to the fullest when her best friend was diagnosed with cancer. Her memoir combines both humor and the serious sides of her life."}, {"text": "When Barack Obama won the presidency, she writes about her reaction, and this allows readers to connect to her as a person. When she and the president-elect drove to the victory parties, she asks: \u201cDid I breathe the air as we stepped outside? Did I thank the person who held open the door as we passed by? Was I smiling?\u201d Her nervousness and every-day manner in which she went through this historic experience shows how human she is; and that she is no different from us."}, {"text": "Obama ends her memoir after her husband\u2019s term as President closes.
