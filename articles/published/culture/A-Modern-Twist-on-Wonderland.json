When Alice Spencer\u2019s friend Alfred is quarantined for tuberculosis, Alice denies his condition. She attempts to heal him by retelling their favorite story, Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland. Like Alice and Alfred, other children have become stranded from their families, and they all take shelter in a make-shift sanctuary in a subway station. In Alice\u2019s story, she and these children each represent fictitious characters. For the children, imagining Wonderland is an escape from the traumas of war."}, {"text": "In a video Q&A session with the musical cast, Steven Sater said that the musical, Alice by Heart is really about the power of the imagination, to get us through the hardest times.\u201d"}, {"text": "Alice\u2019s imaginary Wonderland helps her forget the bleak, war-torn world.
