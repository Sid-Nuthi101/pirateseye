It probably appeared as if we\u2019d known each other for years, but actually we\u2019d only met six hours ago."}, {"text": "Walking through customs was surprisingly fun. The officer who looked over my travel documents asked me who I was and why I\u2019d flown to the island by myself at my age. This was when what began as only an idea felt real \u2013 I was here for a week to volunteer in local communities with a global health organization."}, {"text": "The idea of visiting the D.R. started a few months ago, when I was given the opportunity in Se\u00f1ora Blejwas\u2019 spanish class to research the country. At first, the main search results I found were about Punta Cana and that tourism is a major industry in the country. As I dug deeper, I found out about the darker side of the D.R.. People often live without running water or access to medical care. \u00a0There is little social mobility and the justice system is known to be corrupt. I was concerned by what I was reading."}, {"text": "On a Peace Corps webpage that described the situation in the D.R., I found information about a program called \u201cThe 7 Elements\u201d or 7e. Through this program teenagers around the world are able to volunteer in underdeveloped areas. After eventually convincing my parents to let me go, I applied for the program. Two weeks later, I recieved my acceptance letter and the adventure began."}, {"text": "After the customs officer wished me luck on my project, my group and I exited the airport and boarded the bus that was waiting for us. The forty-five minute long bus ride was the bumpiest I\u2019d ever been on because of the unpaved roads. The ride felt short, though, because of my excitement. As soon as we saw our room, the other five girls and I were surprised and concerned about how we\u2019d be able to get through our week-long stay."}, {"text": "We weren\u2019t used to dealing with spiders the size of golf balls and cockroaches the size of hamsters. We had to adjust to cold showers and sleeping under mosquito nets.

With the help of local masons and community leaders, we spent most of our time working to build a base for the water tank in a local community called Ca\u00f1o Dulce, or the sweet community, because of the delicious mangoes it was known for."}, {"text": "The other days, we worked as \u00a0part of a medical brigade. On our first day, we were trained to take vitals such as blood pressure, temperature, height and weight. Afterwards, we headed to a neighboring community called Nueva York Chiquito, or little New York, because like parts of the famous city, it was built on a foundation of trash. We worked with children, interviewing them in Spanish and distributing vitamins because many of the children were malnourished."}, {"text": "I\u2019ll never forget an experience on the second day of our medical brigade. I met a little girl wearing a faded green dress. She was around eight. When I was interviewing her mother about her health, the daughter began to giggle at my broken Spanish, and gave me a wide, toothy grin."}, {"text": "That moment, and others like it, made my service trip feel less like service, and more like the privilege that it was\u2013 meeting and learning from people beyond the West Windsor community."}], "file_structural_elements": {"title": "Spring break service story: volunteering in the Dominican Republic", "date": "May 21, 2019", "writer": {"LpDIeLwdu280NdPILdWj": {"name": "Ashna Garikapati", "year": "2020"}}, "description": " \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A wave of tropical air hit me as I walked off the plane.
