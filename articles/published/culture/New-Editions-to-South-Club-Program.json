Whether a Pirate is a musician, an academic, an aspiring politician, South has a place for them to prepare for their future.\nThis year, in addition to the dozens of clubs that existed previously at South, many new clubs have been started by South students. These new unique clubs give students the opportunities to create connections, learn new things and be recognized for their interests.\nOne such club is the Music Technology Club. \u201cOur club, we\u2019re more focused on making music rather than playing music,\u201d said Kaeya Gudipati (\u201825), founder of the club.\nThe Music Technology Club provides aspiring composers with tools, resources and space to create musical masterpieces. Gudipati said that the focus isn\u2019t on real musical instruments or on playing them, but instead giving members the opportunity to create music using applications such as Garage Band and Band Lab.\nGudipati started Music Technology to share her passion with like-minded South students.\n\u201c\u200b\u200bI\u2019ve been making music for over a decade now. I\u2019ve always really loved music, so I wanted to share my interest with other people since there\u2019s not many clubs who focus on the technology part of music,\u201d said Gudipati. She wants to give students an avenue to express their love of music, and share it with others.\nThe club also provides members with the chance to display their skills to others, and share their technological compositions. \u201cWe\u2019re planning on creating seasonal projects, like a Halloween project and a Christmas project. Those projects will be featured on either the morning announcements or in the hallways on Fridays,\u201d said Gudipati.\nAnother new addition to South\u2019s diverse list of clubs is the Application and Game Development Club. \u201cOur club is mainly focused on building apps and games,\u201d said founder Mehal Bhattacharya (\u201823).\n\u201cWe use programming languages like Dart, and tools such as Flutter to accomplish building efficient and innovative apps.\u201d\nThe club enables students interested in computer science to develop programs and unique apps with other like minded people. The club is already planning on participating in the Congressional App Challenge, one of the most prestigious coding competitions in the country.\nThis competition tasks students with creating their own original apps and compete in district-wide competitions.\nStudents are excited. Bhattacharya said \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get members into that challenge, and trying to get them to compete because we want to encourage them to innovate and create their own apps and ideas.\u201d\nBhattacharya wants the club to become a sanctuary for creativity and innovation. Open to all, the club is not lecture based and gives members space and freedom to develop whatever their imagination allows them to.\nAnother club new to South is the Disability Rights Student Association Club, or DR. SAC for short, founded by Nikhil Kishore (\u201824).\n\u201cWe, basically, as the name implies, advocate for disabled people and try to raise awareness about disability,\u201d said Kishore.\nAlongside Kishore is co-president/founder Prarthana Harikrishnan (\u201825).\nKishore\u2019s idea to start this club began a long time ago. \u201cI wanted to start a disabilities club in my freshman year, but I just didn\u2019t have the time to register for it,\u201d Kishore said. \u201cSo instead, what happened was that last February, my co-president Prarthana, reached out to me and she pitched the idea that she wanted to start the club so I joined on.\u201d\nThe club aims to reach students and raise empathy and awareness about the obstacles people with disabilities face.\nYou might have heard about one of their projects on the morning announcements.\n\u201cWe are working on a campaign surrounding disability awareness because October is National Disability Employment Awareness Month,\u201d Kishore said. \u201cThis involves putting a poster around room 402 asking students to fill out prompts about their experiences regarding disability and ableism.\u201d\nA long term project of the club is to establish a Disabilities Awareness Month, a month that will focus on teaching students about ableism.\nThe new editions to the South club program this year have given many students more options for clubs in which they can grow, develop and explore. All the clubs are unique in their own. In their goals. In their structure. In their atmosphere.\nAnd, each club is \u2018just right\u2019 for someone in our school. Every student should go out there, explore various clubs and find one that fits them \u2018just right\u2019. And, if they can\u2019t, they can simply create a club of their own next yearMehal Bhattacharya"}], "file_structural_elements": {"title": "New Editions to South Club Program", "date": "November 21, 2022", "writer": {"quV4nroGEIE56FoRMO5F": {"name": "SreeCharani Avula", "year": "2020"}}, "description": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGallery|3 Photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNikhil Kishore \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere at South, one can find over 40 different clubs.
