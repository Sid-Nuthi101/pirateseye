By competing at different events all over the US, they have won all five of the possible Technical Awards at least once over the course of 14 years, and have won four of them this season alone. This is an improvement from the team\u2019s performance in its early years, when they struggled to win awards."}, {"text": "Despite the rocky start, The MidKnight Inventors persevered and continued to compete. Through many successes and some disappointing losses, the team learned to handle every situation with grace."}, {"text": "In the coming years, Kamen hopes to grow the team more. Dr. Kamen said, \u201cDedication, commitment, humbleness and integrity are the basis of this team\u2019s sustainability.\u201d These qualities contribute greatly to the achievements of The MidKnight Inventors.
