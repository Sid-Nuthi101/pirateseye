It lasts 30 days and is based on the Islamic 354-day lunar calendar. Every day during this month, Muslims worldwide cut out all food and water from sunrise to sunset.\nThey also practice self-control in other daily activities such as limiting social media. In doing so, they have the opportunity to reflect on their privileges and acknowledge their blessings. Ramadan is a chance for every Muslim to become the best versions of themselves\u2013the kindest, most empathetic and generous version. The end of Ramadan is celebrated with the holiday Eid.
