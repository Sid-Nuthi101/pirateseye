Taking charge to create their own destinies, thousands of teenagers took to the streets to voice their views for change in both local and global issues. Sophomore Arushi Aggarwal was among those teenagers. \u201cAs a U[nited Nations] fellow, I have been exposed to the increase in the magnitude of youth empowerment across the world,\u201d said Aggarwal, a member of Environmental Club and founder of Unknown 16, a nonprofit for meeting UN goals such as climate reform and closing the gender wage gap in STEM."}, {"text": "\u201c[S]ocial issues are evident all around us and the more we learn about them, the more we can learn how to take action against them,\u201d said Aggarwal. \u201cYouth activism is becoming more and more prominent.\u201d\nJessica Taft, an associate professor of Latin American and Latino Studies at UC Santa Cruz, said in the article in the UC Santa Cruz NewsCenter, \u201cAround the world, we are seeing children and youth engage as social, political and economic actors, demonstrating their capacity to help make social change.\u201d One of the stars of the youth activism in 2019 is 17-year old Greta Thunberg, TIME\u2019s 2019 Person of the Year. She led the Global Climate Strike, which united young protesters\u2013including South students\u2013 around the globe."}, {"text": "Narayanan explained that organizers used the Internet as a way to connect with activists with the common goal of protecting the environment. \u201c[R]egardless of race, class, creed or culture, we all live on the same earth,\u201d said Narayanan. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to protect it.\u201d Aggarwal developed this protective spirit after seeing the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on her grandparents\u2019 house in India. She started programming and was later invited to become a UN fellow and attend the world\u2019s first UN Youth Climate Summit for her initiative with Unknown 16."}, {"text": "\u201cWe are all an array of different people but with a common passion to use our youth power and work towards a better future for ourselves,\u201d said Aggarwal of the Youth Summit attendees."}, {"text": "While Aggarwal combatted climate change internationally, Narayanan focused on environmental issues at home. Environmental club promoted a petition in support of implementing New Jersey\u2019s ban on plastic bags in West Windsor. \u201cI sincerely think plastic bags are such a pertinent issue, not only because the degrading of plastic is so wasteful, but because we live in a very wooded area,\u201d said Narayanan. \u201cAll kinds of animals live here and it\u2019s not fair to destroy their habitat so needlessly when there are better, more sustainable methods of shopping.\u201d"}, {"text": "Shoppers can use biodegradable or reusable bags to avoid plastics which takes up to 1000 years to decompose. Club members also attended a meeting about the plastic ban at the West Windsor Municipal town center to show their support. Narayanan encouraged other South students to meet with the West Windsor Environmental Commission, a group of volunteers selected by the Mayor to consult on environmental policies. \u201cIt\u2019s our job as activists to reach out to the leaders of our community and voice our concerns. Otherwise, it\u2019s impossible for any change to occur,\u201d said Narayanan."}, {"text": "In 2019, Pirates also tackled change in other issues such as women\u2019s rights."}, {"text": "After noticing the lack of girls in her STEM workshops, Aggarwal founded Unknown 16 to encourage girls to follow their passion and lead the charge against gender inequality in the field. South students raised awareness for this gender issue among others as part of the Women\u2019s Empowerment Initiative. Members have participated in protests like the Women\u2019s March in New York City. Going into a new decade, Narayanan and Aggarwal both plan on continuing to fight for change in society alongside other youth activists."}, {"text": "Aggarwal described hopelessness as one of the biggest challenges. \u201cMost people feel that their opinion is bound to get lost somewhere or that it doesn\u2019t matter in the long run.\u201d"}, {"text": "\u201cHowever, in order to take the initiative and spread awareness, it is important to believe that you can make a difference,\u201d Aggarwal added.
