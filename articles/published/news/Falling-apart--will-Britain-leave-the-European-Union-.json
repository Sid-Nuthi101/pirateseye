The rise of Nigel Farage and UKIP in the mid-90s and early 2000s made Brexit a household topic."}, {"text": "The enactment of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which removes Britain from the E.U., has faced opposition from the two largest parties in British Parliament\u2013the ruling Conservative party (who is tasked with implementing it) and the opposition Labour.

Senior Justyn Chang stated that such a close deadline will have the opposite effect. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s better to be done with something \u2013 the closer the deadline the better.\u201d \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The main points of the first round of talks focussed on Northern Ireland, which is a part of the U.K.. Northern Ireland was partitioned after the 1921 Uprising that resulted in the creation of the Irish Republic. \u00a0The open and free movement between the two Irelands has been previously allowed, but Brexit may change this."}, {"text": "\u201cLocal economies would be destroyed with the presence of a hard border as well as one that would split families. Ireland has always been an issue,\u201d said Miles. A hard border would mean heavily restricted movements between the two Irelands."}, {"text": "The plans that have been finalized provide for the creation of a \u00a0porous border between the two, with less restrictions, facilitating a more free movement of people and trade.\n AP Comparative Politics and Globals Studies teacher Erin Schomburg also feels strongly about the situation on the Irish border.

All member countries of the EU \u00a0paid 13 billion Euros annually, as shares of the burden of the total debt for the countries equally. Chang said, \u201cIt\u2019s like a loan.\u201d"}, {"text": "In other words, the price of staying in the E.U. is paying the interest and developmental funds for less economically developed parts of the Union, like Greece or Poland. When the U.K. leaves, it will need to cash out and settle its fair share of the debt all at once. The figure is close to 40 billion Euros."}, {"text": "Such a lackluster deal in some people\u2019s eyes would cost the U.K. more than what they are already paying. \u201cThe actual economic benefits that we got back from the free trade zone and other agreements on trade have in my mind at least outweighed all the downsides of the yearly cost of membership to the Union,\u201d said Miles. \u201cAnd now we are paying so much for the divorce from the E.U. when we are trying to save money. It\u2019s simply not logical.\u201d A free trade zone means restriction free trade between countries in the zone.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From Chang\u2019s perspective, \u00a0keeping with the Brexit bill is an \u201covertly cheaper option.\u201d He explained that it was like paying back all the debt at once rather than simply paying for the interest rate on it. That\u2019s the U.K.\u2019s best option."}, {"text": "The current situation in the U.K. has been the hampered by the government\u2019s failure to secure the necessary votes in Parliament to agree on the exit plans. \u00a0The resignation of several key cabinet ministers, most notably the Brexit secretary Dominic Raab who was in charge of the transition, has not helped move things forward. The result of such a divide could lead to either a hard Brexit, which would result in the severing of diplomatic ties to the E.U., or a possible second popular referendum. This second referendum would mean the first could be overturned, preventing Brexit from happening."}, {"text": "Whether or not Brexit will materialize is a matter of political might. Because May survived the vote of no confidence against her on Dec 12, she has strengthened her position in Parliament.
