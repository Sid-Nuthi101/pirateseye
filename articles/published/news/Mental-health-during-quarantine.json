You need to socialize,\u201d said Ms. Jill O\u2019Connell, physical education and health teacher. According to the Canadian Mental Health Association, it is very important to be socially connected because it can help to regulate emotions, lower stress or isolation and lead to higher self-esteem."}, {"text": "Ms. Allen said, \u201cI also think it\u2019ll be such a great thing to be able to hug my mom again or hug anybody.
