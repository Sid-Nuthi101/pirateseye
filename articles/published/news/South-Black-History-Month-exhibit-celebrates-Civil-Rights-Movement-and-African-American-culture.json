Multicultural Studies is a history elective taught by Mr. Fisher. He explained, \u201cThe last couple of years have brought up a lot of issues to talk about amongst the different races. So multicultural studies is about being able to see a lot of different lenses of society in 2019.\u201d \u00a0This is the second year that students from these groups have participated in the Black History Museum."}, {"text": "South had its first Black History Month event in 1988, when Dr. Royster first started working at the school. She said, \u201cAt the time, I was coming out of college and I had a lot of ideas about women and people of African American descent.\u201d These ideas translated to a tradition of annual Black History Month events at South. Although, initially, the first few events were \u201cexperimental,\u201d \u00a0they peaked the interest of the school community and inspired different events for the future. For example, there have been read-ins where different people brought artifacts, authentic books and artwork from their own family."}, {"text": "In recent years, South students curated a museum in the library that contains different exhibits about significant people and events in African-American history. The beautiful displays in the museum are provided by business called Museums in Motion. Some of the stunning pieces at the exhibits were authentic, while others were replicas."}, {"text": "Some of the most notable pieces at the museum included replicated costumes of the rhythm and blues (R&B) singing group The Supremes and singer Lena Horne.

In September, students from BSU and Multicultural Studies were given a list of people and events that would be featured in the museum. Senior Snehi Mukkamalla, Treasurer of BSU, said, \u201c[O]ur job was to do the research about each exhibit and present it to the people who come to the museum.\u201d Dr. Royster put great emphasis on the fact that she wanted the tours to be \u201cfluid and well-researched\u201d so that people who came to the museum would surely leave with new and interesting information."}, {"text": "South staff and students were not the only ones who were able to experience the Black History Museum. Fourth and fifth graders and administrators from all over the district were invited during and after school hours to view the exhibits and go on tours of the museum."}, {"text": "Dr. Royster feels that it is important for South\u2019s diverse student population to be knowledgeable about the histories of all cultures. As a woman of African American descent, she is pleased that the Black History Museum shines a light on the role of African Americans in building the nation."}, {"text": "Students who took part in organizing the museum are also very passionate about its effect on the school community. Mukkamalla said, \u201cThis is stuff that you can\u2019t really learn in a textbook. A lot of it is things that we don\u2019t really talk about.\u201d She wanted to take the opportunity to celebrate and showcase the accomplishments of African-Americans that often get \u201cbrushed over in most textbooks.\u201d"}, {"text": "Darlene Nawuridam, President of BSU, recalled her experience walking through the museum last year. \u201cThe information at the exhibits impacted me a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there was a lot of information that I didn\u2019t even know was a part of Black History.\u201d This experience inspired Nawuridam to teach others about African-American history. \u201cI really wanted people to feel the way I did when I tell them about the people and events in Black History.\u201d"}, {"text": "Mr. Fisher believes that the Black History Month events are allowing the school community to evolve as an accepting and open-minded environment.

With so many students from around the world, she believes that it is important to be aware and appreciative of all of the diversity each culture has to offer. \u201cI want there to be an understanding that we have, as people, as human beings, more in common than we have differences.\u201d"}], "file_structural_elements": {"title": "South Black History Month exhibit celebrates Civil Rights Movement and African-American culture", "date": "March 28, 2019", "writer": {"ejT8eIFC22HFHKCSbhPm": {"name": "Ankita Nair", "year": "2020"}}, "description": " \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Black History Month shines a spotlight on the struggles and achievements of African-Americans to recognize that their stories are interwoven into the narrative of America. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0South hosted a Black History Museum from Jan. 31 to Feb. 4 in the school\u2019s library.
