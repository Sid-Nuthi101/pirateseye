Students then perform a warm up routine to get their muscles ready for the rest of class and spend the majority of the time perfecting their latest routine or learning a new skill.\nIn addition to Dance 1, Emerging Financial Markets is also a new elective. Taught by Mr. Joshua Crome, students taking Emerging Financial markets learn about traditional and more modernized technological finances such as cryptocurrency, knowledge which they can apply over the course of their lives even after they graduate from South.\n\u201cI want all my students to know the doors to building wealth prudently over long periods of time are open to all of us now in ways they weren\u2019t even 15 years ago,\u201d said Mr. Crome.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The main areas of study for this course consist of Financial Technologies, Automated Investing, and Sustainable Investing.\n\u201cI anticipate gaining an exposure to various types of investments, from traditional ones like stocks and bonds to upcoming types like cryptocurrency and NFTs, and the laws that govern them,\u201d said Nandika Karnik (\u201823)."}, {"text": "Along with learning about various financial topics, one of the ways students will be able to grasp the financial world\u2019s reality is by observing the effects of it on well known figures.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen Kim Kardashian pop up in financial news headlines quite a bit,\u201d said Mr. Crome. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how there\u2019s this intersection between thinking of finance as a bunch of people in business suits and a paneled boardroom, but finance is everybody.
