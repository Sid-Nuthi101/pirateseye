The focus of the transition is carrying over concepts from Algebra 1 to Algebra 2, explained Peter Collura, an Algebra 2 teacher at South. We want to avoid the gap between Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 where students tend to forget things, Collura explained."}, {"text": "\u201cThe familiar skill set (from Algebra 1) reviewed at the beginning of Algebra 2 will ease the students\u2019 transition between middle and high school,\u201d said Andrea Bean, district Mathematics supervisor for grades six to 12.

His math partner sophomore Trisha Murali said that for her solving problems\u201d is more like starting fresh because Algebra 1 was two school years ago.\u201d She finds Julian\u2019s prior knowledge helpful when she forgets basic concepts."}, {"text": "At first, there were some concerns that the freshman would not feel comfortable around their older peers. This has not turned out to be the case. Along with most of their class, both Murali and her partner Julian agree that they are happy with their multi-grade math class. While the mix of freshman and sophomores in math classes is only a part of the first year transition, the multi-age classroom has its own benefits."}, {"text": "According to the Center for Evaluation and Education Policy, multi-age classrooms create a more caring environment between students, because the close environment encourages students to talk to each other. In addition to this, these classrooms also reach a \u201chigher cognitive developmental level at a faster rate than those in classrooms of same-age peers.\u201d."}, {"text": "Other math classes are experiencing a slower transition. \u201cWe are still working up to that relationship,\u201d said Collura. \u201cSo far I have not seen any difficulties with the transition, but I have a suspicion that they are there and [the students] are not expressing it now.
