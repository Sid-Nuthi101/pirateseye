The accused paid Singer to bribe college coaches and test proctors, modify student test scores, and re-write false student biographies."}, {"text": "Singer has pleaded guilty to four charges, including racketeering conspiracy: illegal dealings and actions to gain money, money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and obstruction of justice."}, {"text": "At the center of this scandal is actress Lori Loughlin. Loughlin, most famous for her role as Aunt Becky on \u201cFull House,\u201d and her husband, Mossimo Gianulli, paid $500,000 for the admission of their 19 year old and 20 year old daughters to USC."}, {"text": "Loughlin worked with Singer and the head coach of crew at USC, Josh Adam, to falsely recruit Loughlin\u2019s two daughters onto the team.

Several of the schools fired coaching staff that had recruited students through bribery onto their respective teams."}, {"text": "Colleges, such as USC, have stated that any students tied to the scandal would be denied admission and that a review would be conducted on students already admitted at the university."}, {"text": "South Senior, Susan George, said, \u201cAfter hearing about the admissions scandal, I was kind of mad as individuals who were extremely privileged could put in the minimal amount of effort and still get into the top schools.\u201d"}, {"text": "Admitted and prospective students of the respective colleges involved are angered by the scandal.

If convicted the parents could face several years in prison and pay a substantial fine. When asked about the stigma associated with college admissions, guidance counselor Antonella Facchini said, \u201cI think for some it is a about getting into a certain name school, a certain type of selective school and that\u2019s very unfortunate. We keep hearing the same 20 or 30 colleges and it\u2019s put an exorbitant amount of pressure on students and families and I think there is competition, sometimes, between families.\u201d"}, {"text": "Loughlin was reportedly fixated on gaining admission for her children into prestigious and well-known schools.

I really just want [students] to learn from this and realize that money, although it can get you a lot of things, it doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t responsible for your actions.\u201d"}], "file_structural_elements": {"title": "College admissions scandal: how far will money get you?", "date": "May 21, 2019", "writer": {"bijQTp8MbBbMBsVjvq8V": {"name": "Varsha Gollarhalli", "year": "2018"}}, "description": " \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On March 12 federal prosecutors charged over 33 parents and 13 coaches in a college admissions scandal.
