Editor-in-chief Aarushi Bansal (\u201823) finds Echoes club a haven for creative\u00a0 expression. \u201cI love the community Echoes provides to\u00a0 both artists and writers, the safe space it creates for us to flourish. Through critiquing the art and writing pieces of\u00a0 our peers, we\u2019re able to observe the hidden talents of\u00a0 South students,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Amaidhiameya Ilangovan-Arya (\u201824), an artist\u00a0 and writer in the club, said, \u201cI enjoy coming to Echoes because it is a very calming environment and our club activities have helped me develop my creative skills."}, {"text": "Inspired in part by the National Novel Writing Month, during the week of Nov. 28, Echoes hosted their\u00a0 first creative writing work- shop of the year. \u201cI wanted to give the creative writers at our school a chance to develop their skills and also share their work with the South community,\u201d Bansal said. The workshop acted as a craft-focused session for students to develop various components of their short story, including structure, character development and\u00a0 dialogue. Specifically, students learned about how it\u2019s\u00a0 important to have a setting\u00a0 that is important to the story, by also describing the\u00a0 importance of the setting in Harry Potter."}, {"text": "Students also learned techniques for how character development drives the greater plot. \u201cWhen writing a short\u00a0 story, focus less on characters and more on the\u00a0 story itself. The physical appearance of the character\u00a0 isn\u2019t as important compared\u00a0 to the plot,\u201d Bansal said. \u201cInstead of hearing about the\u00a0 length of their hair or the color of their eyes, tell me\u00a0 more about their personality and their thoughts. This\u00a0 will help readers become emotionally invested in the story faster because in a shorter piece, one doesn\u2019t have as much time to build up the plot.\u201d Advice like this has been helpful to developing writers of the club.\u201d"}, {"text": "Even though I only joined recently, I think\u00a0 being part of Echoes has already improved my writing\u00a0 skills and my appreciation of art,\u201d Ilangovan-Arya said.\u00a0 Echoes has allowed writers and artists to grow, improving both their crafts\u00a0 and their mindsets. Ilangovan-Arya said, \u201cIn the club,\u00a0 we do a lot of fun writing and drawing exercises that push my limits and help me be less of a perfectionist.\u201d"}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "PHOTO BY SRI SOWMYA TANGUTURI (\u201926)"}, {"text": ""}], "file_structural_elements": {"title": "Echoes", "date": "January 5, 2023", "writer": {"": {"name": "Sri Sowmya Tanguturi", "year": ""}}, "description": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aboard South\u2019s pirate ship, we\u2019ve been sailing the misty seas, steering the world of creative writing and visual\u00a0 arts since 1976.
