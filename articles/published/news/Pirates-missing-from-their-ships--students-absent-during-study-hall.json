Three tardies in a class equals an unexcused absence, and students need 90 percent attendance for the class to count towards high school credits and grades."}, {"text": "The sign-in system can have technical issues. For example, if a student has multiple classes requiring them to sign in, then sometimes they may sign themselves out of a previous class instead of into their current class. Other times, a student may attend but forget to sign in."}, {"text": "Ms. Hanos says that students can rectify errors with her if they have a note from their proctor."}, {"text": "To senior Gracen Tate, the administration\u2019s response at first seemed stringent, but she realized the rules were only helping prepare students to be good citizens."}, {"text": "\u201cThey help you be responsible for time and also to be mature,\u201d said Tate."}, {"text": "But errors are not the only reason for the new policies.

However, Tate thinks the impact absences have on grades and school records is enough deterrence. Nidumbur believes the extra restrictions are making it harder to leave class, especially with the requirement of a pass."}, {"text": "\u201cThere are people who are monitoring students going outside of study hall and seeing whether they have a pass,\u201d said Nidumbur. \u201cAnd overall, I\u2019ve been seeing a lot more strict rules surrounding study hall and sub study.\u201d"}, {"text": "One reason why students are walking around between classes may be because proctors are limited in their ability to enforce attendance.
