Development Programme\u2019s 2019 Global Outlook Report, \u201c the impacts of climate change have been growing; often with terrifying results, ranging from wildfires, droughts, flooding, and hurricanes to sea-level rise, ocean acidification to the melting of the permafrost.\u201d"}, {"text": "Specifically, demanding an end to the age of fossil fuels was a priority for strikers because, \u201ccarbon dioxide (CO2) from burning fossil fuels is the dominant source of heat-trapping emissions.\u201d"}, {"text": "As a leader and chief organizer of the Global Climate Strike, Thunberg specifically called on young people to take charge and join her initiative.

The speakers encouraged students to take measures toward a more sustainable future by making small changes like carpooling, using less plastic and voting for representatives who prioritize climate action."}, {"text": "South\u2019s climate strike speakers also stressed the need for students to continue the momentum of the Global Climate Strike in their daily lives. Raman said the best way to sustain the movement and make a difference is to \u00a8be aware of how the small actions we take can have a large impact\u201d and to join organizations like South\u2019s Environmental Club. The Environmental Club holds bi-monthly meetings in room 700D for students interested in making sustainable changes. The next meeting is scheduled for Oct. 30."}, {"text": "Thunberg hopes to maintain and increase this united, worldwide effort for climate action. Between Sept. 20 and 27, the strike amassed 7.6 million strikers in 185 different countries. To keep protesters involved, the movement also serves as a resource to find local campaigns, and collaborates with Fridays for Future to continue weekly strikes. The next global strike is set to take place on Feb. 15. Many expect this grassroots movement for climate action will grow."}, {"text": "The U.N.
