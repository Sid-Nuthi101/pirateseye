Masks are often made of propylene, a thermoplastic resin that is contributing to massive plastic piles. England has also seen a spike. For example, an article from The Conversation said that 2.3 billion personal protective equipment (PPE) products have been given to health and social care services from February to July in England, the same amount distributed in all of 2019."}, {"text": "But masks and PPE are not the only contributors to the rise of plastic.
