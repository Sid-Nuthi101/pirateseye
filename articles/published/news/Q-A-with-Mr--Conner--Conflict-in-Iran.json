This news startled everyone at the beginning of the new year, but what has happened since then?

I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s coming down but I was just looking at a news report from today [Jan. 27] saying that there were some rockets that hit the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, so I would say that there\u2019s severe tension right now between the United States and Iran, over the assassination of Soleimani."}, {"text": "What is the United States\u2019 political relationship to Iran like?"}, {"text": "Iran has a big influence on Iraq, and the United States has some real problems with Iran. I was looking over the current president\u2019s Secretary of State\u2019s letter on this. It says that the United States under President Trump has laid out some ideas on this, and it looks at Iran as a terrorist country. The reason why is because the president has said that normal countries don\u2019t attack embassies. They don\u2019t fuel terrorist proxies and it goes on and on."}, {"text": "Is there an event in particular that sparked this bad relationship?"}, {"text": "It goes back to 1979-80 when our embassy was taken over by Iran in Baghdad. We actually had a marine who was a guard in the embassy \u2013 I happened to know him because I was a reserve \u2013 he talked about the actual takeover of the embassy. Ever since then, it\u2019s been pretty much downhill in terms of our relationship with them. We\u2019ve broken off diplomatic relations with them and treat them as a terrorist state. That\u2019s pretty much where we are right now."}, {"text": "What is Ukraine\u2019s involvement in the situation?"}, {"text": "The Iranians accidentally shot down a Ukranian plane right after they shot some missiles at us after the U.S. assassinated Soleimani. Minutes after taking off from Tehran airport in Iran, the plane was shot down. It had Canadian citizens on board. The whole incident of the Ukrainians and how they relate to the United States and how they relate to Iran and other states really comes to play. Ukrainian officials are also skeptical of us. Some of that has to do with the impeachment that\u2019s going on and Ukraine\u2019s involvement in that. We don\u2019t look at Ukraine as a completely trustworthy partner yet and the Ukranians treat the Iranians as if they don\u2019t fully trust them because they\u2019re a strong ally of Russia, which is still at war with Ukraine."}, {"text": "Do you think the situation between the two countries has de-escalated?"}, {"text": "To be honest, it\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s going to happen right now.
