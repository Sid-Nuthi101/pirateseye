Then came Maria, a category five on the Saffir Simpson scale. The National Weather Service declared that the storm struck the island as a strong category four hurricane with sustained winds as high as of 155 mph."}, {"text": "Although the storm swept over Puerto Rico for only a few hours, it produced heavy rainfall that caused major catastrophic flooding and flash flooding, which resulted in significant \u00a0\u00a0damage to property and the loss of lives.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s definitely an incredibly traumatic event and quite disheartening,\u201dsaid senior Fayiz Faruk. \u201cEspecially since the storms happened within a week of one another, and the survivors were not given a chance to stand before the next storm. We just have to feel for them.\u201d"}, {"text": "Nearly 3,000 Puerto Ricans were injured. According to CNN Money\u2019s Analytics, the initial storm damage represented almost an entire year\u2019s economic output for Puerto Rico, at almost 40 billion dollars. In a recent report from the island\u2019s government to Congress, the total recovery cost for the island\u2019s infrastructure and industry is now at $139 billion.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The island\u2019s federal recovery aid requests have also been hampered by a number of debt recovery measures forced upon the island to repay it\u2019s almost $70 billion in accumulated debts."}, {"text": "Puerto Rico has no elected voice in Congress. Sure it does have congressional representatives, but they have no voting ability like representatives from the mainland, leaving the Puerto Rican people with no federal recourse to challenge the government\u2019s decision to give only $19 billion of the initial request of $46 billion in aid."}, {"text": "According to some experts the current recovery effort hasn\u2019t met the needs of the devastation.

This however is easier said than done, as many mainland charities don\u2019t consider the island to be American enough for local aid. \u00a0For example, national charities contributed $341 million in post-strom support to Texas and $128 million that was donated to Florida\u2019s recovery. Thanks to these charitable efforts, as well as a much more \u201crobust\u201d government response, Texas and Florida were back on their feet in a matter of weeks."}, {"text": "Puerto Rico is \u00a0not \u201cforeign\u201d enough for foreign aid and \u00a0not local enough for domestic."}, {"text": "The storms were, by any stretch of the imagination, a catastrophe of the highest order. \u00a0And to people who have family on the island, like myself, it was a deeply personal one.

My uncle who lives in the mountains of historic Ponce lost a wall, in addition to similar roof damage."}, {"text": "But this experience also made me especially thankful for the efforts of South students to help those who were affected by the storms. Early in the 2017 school year there was a joint Red Cross club and Student Council fundraiser that raised money by selling \u00a0t-shirts. The resulting proceeds were sent to the International Red Cross, which at the time was involved in the response and relief effort on the island."}, {"text": "On an island where even the traffic lights are not yet working, every bit helps. But more needs to be done. \u201cSouth is a giving school,\u201d said Honap. \u201cAnd if we knew how I\u2019m sure we would do more.\u201d South can help in many different ways; from volunteering their time or donating money."}, {"text": "The best way to help, though, is raising awareness. Many students have forgotten or are unsure about what is happening in Puerto Rico. We can\u2019t pride ourselves on being globally aware citizens when we ignore domestic crises like these."}, {"text": "Faruk said, \u201cAwareness would bode very well, as more hearts and minds at the end of the day mean more people willing to act overall.\u201d\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the failure of efforts by federal and national charitable organizations, the only way Puerto Rico can heal right now is with the help of private citizens. ."}, {"text": "Our contributions may be an hour of volunteer time or raising awareness about the plight of our fellow citizens who are still calling for our assistance."}, {"text": "PHOTO COURTESY: RICHARD MAFFEI"}], "file_structural_elements": {"title": "Puerto Rico remains attempting to recover from devastating hurricanes", "date": "November 14, 2018", "writer": {"K0XYYhODXZQZ46XQPVNR": {"name": "Richard Maffei", "year": "2018"}}, "description": " \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two hurricanes ravaged the Caribbean U.S. territory of Puerto Rico in the late summer of 2017.
