After all, the Columbine High School shooting was 20 years ago and since then our government has failed to establish even the most basic gun violence prevention strategy of expanding background checks. More than 311,000 students have become victims of gun violence in the past 23 years and more have been gripped by the fear of gun threats at their own schools."}, {"text": "It\u2019s easy for fellow students to feel helpless in situations like these."}, {"text": "Despite ineffective preventions of gun violence in schools, some remain hopeful that school walkouts will bring about the change they hope to see."}, {"text": "\u201cWhen we see or hear these news stories about kids our age and kids even younger than us, it\u2019s truly heartbreaking,\u201d said Nirali Sanghvi, the president of Students Demand Action, speaking about the Uvalde shooting. \u201cAs youths, we are directly impacted by the issue of gun control and we have to make sure we make our voices heard. By walking out and standing with the families who are forever impacted by gun violence, we send a strong message by showing solidarity, unity, and discontent with our current regula tion policies.\u201d"}, {"text": "Junior Anushri Dwivedi agreed. She said, \u201cA lot of the times students don\u2019t feel like they have the power to do anything because they\u2019re not adults and no one will listen to them. But I think walkouts are an effective way for students to peacefully protest because if everyone is coming together for a certain cause and they\u2019re walking out, it sends a message.\u201d"}, {"text": "Whether you think walkouts are effective or not, action must be taken against gun violence in schools."}, {"text": "\u201cGun violence is the leading cause of death for children in the United States.
