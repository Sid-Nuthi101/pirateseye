For the first time in the\u00a0 history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU),\u00a0 there was a holiday special short film released with\u00a0 everyone\u2019s favorite Guardians, who displayed familial\u00a0 bonds among friends."}, {"text": "Before venturing off to\u00a0 Earth, the Guardians are seen rebuilding Knowhere, where Drax, played by Dave Bautista, and Mantis, played by Pom Klementieff, see Star-Lord, played by Chris\u00a0 Pratt loathing the Christmas cheer."}, {"text": "Additionally, Star-Lord is grief-stricken by the death of the \u201coriginal\u201d Gamora. Seeing their leader in this condition is heartbreaking\u00a0 for the rest of the Guardians, so they decide to find\u00a0 him the perfect Christmas present: his favorite Earth actor Kevin Bacon."}, {"text": "Drax and Mantis\u2019 adventure throughout the film is\u00a0 full of amusing comedy and the chemistry between the actors is just as good in the\u00a0 first film. The performances, while shorter, from Pratt,\u00a0 Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan and Gunn were also a\u00a0 great addition to the film."}, {"text": "As Mantis and Drax land\u00a0 on Earth, they locate Kevin Bacon\u2019s house in Beverly\u00a0 Hills. Bacon is terrified of Mantis and Drax\u2019s sudden appearance and calls the police, but Mantis resolves this complication by putting both Kevin Bacon and the police in the trance as they take Bacon to Knowhere."}, {"text": "After returning to Knowhere, the Guardians throw\u00a0 Quill a surprise Christmas\u00a0 party, where Quill is horrified to find out that Kevin\u00a0 Bacon has been kidnapped\u00a0 against his will and demands that he be returned."}, {"text": "Before going back to\u00a0 Earth, Kraglin reveals to Bacon how he inspired Quill\u2019s\u00a0 desire to be a hero, and\u00a0 agrees to return and celebrate Christmas with the\u00a0 Guardians."}, {"text": "The film has themes of friendship, family and the Christmas spirit.

Each of them got to show how they are some of the most beloved characters in the entire MCU ."}, {"text": "Arfa Hassan(\u201825) said, \u201cThey\u2019ve [the Guardians] all made an impact on my watching experience ever since the first Guardians movie.\u201d"}, {"text": "The film\u2019s cinematography was commendable, especially in the scene that\u00a0 showed the build up to the\u00a0 big reveal of Knowhere covered in Christmas lights,\u00a0 and seeing Star-Lord\u2019s reaction to it all. Additionally, the scenes in which the\u00a0 Guardians travel through space were well-edited. The\u00a0 appearance of Groot\u2019s character without CGI throughout the movie was a nice\u00a0 touch and provides a nice preview for the upcoming movie, \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\u201d."}, {"text": "The characters were portrayed very well in the short\u00a0 film, and the actors played their roles in a way that the characters seemed more like\u00a0 family than just extraterrestrial co-workers to new\u00a0 viewers and long-time Marvel fans. We appreciated that\u00a0 the Guardians put their best efforts to help Quill re-learn the meaning of Christmas,\u00a0 despite their limited knowledge of Christmas traditions."}, {"text": "This short film was a new opportunity for the Marvel franchise to branch\u00a0 out into themes often overlooked. While they usually\u00a0 present action-filled plots and nail-biting scenes, they delivered a short film with\u00a0 family themes and a Christmas movie to remember."}, {"text": "IMAGE BY SMITI YADLA (\u201925)"}], "file_structural_elements": {"title": "A holiday special done right", "date": "January 5, 2023", "writer": {"": {"name": "Connor Florendo, Smiti Yadla, Aadya Srivastava", "year": ""}}, "description": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finding the perfect Christmas gift is a difficult task\u00a0 during the holiday season, and it is no different for the\u00a0 renowned intergalactic superheroes in \u201cGuardians of\u00a0 the Galaxy: Holiday Special.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGuardians of the Galaxy:\u00a0 Holiday Special\u201d was released on Nov. 25 on Disney\u00a0 Plus.
