When you reverse a car, it is imperative to look through your back window to make sure no one is walking behind you, there are no cars zooming by behind you or another car isn\u2019t backing up at the same time as you. This means physically turning around and looking back \u2014 not only looking into the rear view camera or just checking through the rearview mirror."}, {"text": "Students don\u2019t tend to look all the way back due to the physical effort it takes to rotate for a moment They also may be on their phones, or their modern cars have a camera to show the pavement behind them."}, {"text": "With the density of the parking lot at the end of the day, there is almost always someone or something behind you when you are reversing. So, the message is: if you\u2019re going backward in your car, you should be looking backward, too."}, {"text": "Even the parking itself is something that we need to talk about. The lines painted on the pavement are there for you to park between. This doesn\u2019t mean on them, through them, or across them. The parking lot is meant for parking. So, if you can\u2019t learn to park, maybe don\u2019t try in the school parking lot."}, {"text": "One of the main reasons students exhibit reckless driving is to show off to their friends. Senior Alexis Esi said, \u201cIf you feel that the school parking lot is an appropriate place to show off your car\u2019s prowess to your friends, you\u2019re simply wrong. It is unfair to the rest of us for you to put us in danger for a couple of revs.\u201d"}, {"text": "Many times, students will speed through the aisles of the parking lot, ignoring people walking through or other cars driving. Whether this is to look cool or to simply rush to their next destination, this behavior is dangerous and can cause accidents."}, {"text": "Esi explained, \u201cEverybody feels like they need to go where they\u2019re going as fast as they can, which leads to the kind of fast and risky behavior that leads to accidents.\u201d Realize that it is better to get somewhere a few minutes late, rather than hours late and pay a few hundred dollars because you got into an accident."}, {"text": "\u201cWe should be more calm on the way out [of] school,\u201d Jaswal said. \u201cIt takes time to get out of the lot and people should just understand that. There\u2019s no reason to freak out and try to floor it.\u201d"}, {"text": "If you have the privilege of having a car and the ability to park in the school parking lot, don\u2019t abuse it by putting others in danger."}], "file_structural_elements": {"title": "Editorial: If you are parking in the South parking lot, drive safely", "date": "April 1, 2019", "writer": null, "description": " \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Honking, revving engines, and blasting music: the symphony of the South parking lot at the end of the school day.
