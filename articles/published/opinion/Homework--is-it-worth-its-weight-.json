The remaining 90 percent is distributed differently depending on the class, but in most classes, it is reserved for assessment grades. In World Language classes, it is split up between Interpretive, Interpersonal, Presentational and Supportive Assessments. This means the time and effort students put in for homework does not shine through as much as acing a test does."}, {"text": "Biology teacher Meenakshi Bhattacharya said, \u201cIn order to understand the material better, we give you the home-work, in which you practice that material.\u201d The weight of homework assignments toward the final class grade causes students to neglect this purpose and not use it as a learning tool because they don\u2019t feel the hard work is worth it if it doesn\u2019t affect their class\u2019s overall grade."}, {"text": "French teacher Szilvia Juhasz said, \u201cWith some students, I see if you tell them this is something you need for an assessment, they will put more effort into it.\u201d This is a common mentality among students: they are more likely to work harder on homework that will help them get a better course grade."}, {"text": "Students have little motivation to complete homework assignments.

But assessments are given a significantly higher weight. Giving homework assignments such a small weight in comparison to assessment grades gives students the message that what they know is more important than how much they learn."}, {"text": "Tests may not correctly assess how much the student knows and has learned throughout a unit. Freshman Dharma Rajesh said, \u201cIn subjects like World History sometimes if you don\u2019t remember something it can reflect that you don\u2019t know anything, which is not really the case.\u201d Homework assignments are created to help students practice the content they need more help with and to further their understanding."}, {"text": "Sophomore Sophia Kravets said, \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to practice.
