Cheryl Smith, a guidance counselor at South, said \u201cThe [test-optional] colleges\u2019 goal is to look at a student\u2019s progression throughout the transcript, rather than focusing so heavily on test scores.\u201d"}, {"text": "This does not mean, however, that test-optional schools are any less esteemed than traditional colleges. The application process is still legitimate, as the student\u2019s academic record is important. These colleges often ask to see a student\u2019s writing samples and letters of recommendation. Additionally, test-optional colleges pay close attention to the activities students are involved in outside of school."}, {"text": "This approach is more fair to all students, as test scores do not reflect one\u2019s intelligence because some students are simply good test-takers. This does not necessarily mean that they are proficient in the subjects that they are being tested in."}, {"text": "\u201cYour college acceptance should not be determined by your SAT score,\u201d said Ishita Pandey, a sophomore. \u201cIt does not give everyone a fair chance.\u201d"}, {"text": "Additionally, due to programs that teach strategies for standardized tests, students who struggle with certain topics may still do well on tests by applying test-taking techniques."}, {"text": "On the contrary, a student may be very skilled in a subject that is not reflected on the test. A lower test score may cause colleges to turn such students away, even though they are remarkable in other aspects of the application. Ishita\u2019s brother Abhinav, a junior, said \u201cThe SAT is only one small part of [a student\u2019s] high school years, so colleges should pay attention to other things, as well.\u201d"}, {"text": "A 2014 study conducted by William Hiss, Former Dean of Admissions for Bates College, compared the grades of students who submitted their SAT and ACT scores, as well as their high school graduation rates. The study concluded that the difference in college performance between the two groups was insignificant:there was only a 0.6 percent difference in graduation rates of students who submitted their test scores and those who did not."}, {"text": "In addition, a study done by Steve Seyerson and his team at the University of Washington revealed that test-optional schools provide students from underprivileged areas an opportunity that they would not otherwise be presented. \u201cOur study clearly supports the notion that if an institution wants to do a better job serving traditionally undeserved populations, test-optional [policies] can provide a very useful tool,\u201d Seyerson said."}, {"text": "Moreover, College Board and ACT tests are expensive. Students pay not only for the test itself, but also for study materials and tutoring. Students from low socioeconomic areas may not have the resources to experience the benefits of taking practice tests and retaking the tests."}, {"text": "Albeit the many obvious advantages of test-optional schools, many people are still not certain about this increasingly popular approach to the college application process."}, {"text": "Sanya Nair, a sophomore, said, \u201cWhat if certain students live in areas where there aren\u2019t many opportunities to volunteer or do activities outside of school?\u201d This issue is one that can easily be overlooked, as colleges pay attention to all extracurricular activities \u2014 from babysitting \u00a0to joining a robotics team. No matter the social class or economic status of the student, anyone can get involved in their community."}, {"text": "Overall, there is a lot more to a well-rounded student than a mere test score. Test-optional schools increase diversity in colleges and provide opportunities to more students than ever before. These colleges are proving that a student is more than a test score."}, {"text": "IMAGE COURTESY: WWW.FLICKR.COM"}], "file_structural_elements": {"title": "Test-optional schools: looking beyond test scores", "date": "November 14, 2018", "writer": {"ejT8eIFC22HFHKCSbhPm": {"name": "Ankita Nair", "year": "2020"}}, "description": " \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every year students scramble to find the best tutors and textbooks to guide them through the biggest obstacle course known to any high schooler: the dreaded SAT.
