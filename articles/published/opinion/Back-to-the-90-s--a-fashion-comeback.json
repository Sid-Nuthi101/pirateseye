Because of this trend, the fashion industry began selling more items that mimicked the \u201cgrunge,\u201d or more unkempt, style of the band members. Outfits such as flannel shirts over band t-shirts and floral dresses paired with combat boots quickly became iconic."}, {"text": "By breaking free of the typical fashion mold, the \u201cgrunge\u201d style became a symbol of self-expression.
