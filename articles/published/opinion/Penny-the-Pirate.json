The first step is to connect with them by following them. If they are using social media and they know you, they are going to follow you back. After a couple of days, start chatting."}, {"text": "A good way to start a conversation is by finding common ground. For example, you can comment about a picture they posted recently in a restaurant. Food is one of the easiest things to bond over. Once you have something you share, it will become easier to connect with that person and have more conversations. They won\u2019t always be receptive, but don\u2019t be scared to try."}, {"text": "Homework"}, {"text": "We all struggle with homework and if your potential friend happens to be in the same class as you, ask them for help about something you\u2019re struggling with. You might even be able to help them out in turn! This can be a great way to make friends and you can have regular conversations if you both want to check your homework answers. Just text them one day or send them a message on Google Hangouts about a question you have. Google Hangouts is the best way to contact someone during virtual school. If texting someone directly is too hard, take advantage of breakout rooms in classes. Don\u2019t just turn off your audio and video. Start talking there first so it won\u2019t feel awkward when you text them later."}, {"text": "Hallways"}, {"text": "If you attend in-person classes, hallways are one of the easiest places to make friends. As the bell rings and everyone starts to leave, talk to your friend while staying socially distant. Ask about homework, a test, or the extra credit assignment. On the way to your next class, you can also talk about what class they\u2019re going to. The next day, maybe you just happen to be going past their desk when class ends. Keep saying \u201chi.\u201d\u00a0 Soon, these hi\u2019s will lead to casual relationships and with time, this might develop into a deeper friendship. It might be scary, but it\u2019s always worth it. The friendships I have made with my fellow pirates wouldn\u2019t be possible without these everyday greetings. With time and some effort, you\u2019ll find yourself leaving the class together. However, don\u2019t force it, somethings are meant to happen organically."}, {"text": "It only takes a couple of friendly gestures to properly get to know a person.
