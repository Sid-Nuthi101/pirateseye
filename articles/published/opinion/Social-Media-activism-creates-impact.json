Social media makes it convenient to get people\u2019s attention because it\u2019s the fastest way to reach a large public.

There were over 11 million posts about it, most encouraging people to attend local protests supporting the cause."}, {"text": "Some argue that it\u2019s impossible to fight for social justice through a screen.
