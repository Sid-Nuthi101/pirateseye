The current grading system tends to create a fear of failure rather than serve as motivation to do better. Students put too much value on their grades rather than embracing the learning process. This often leads to students memorizing information for a test and forgetting it soon after."}, {"text": "Experts agree that the grading system is broken. According to an article by Kara Duriez on the Penn State University website, the pressure to achieve good grades leads to grade obsession, which can cause emotional and physical stress.

As a result of quarantine, some students find themselves in challenging situations: some are now responsible for taking care of their siblings or have experienced a family member getting sick. Some students are just stressed from isolation. Even under all these added pressures, students are still expected to be active in school and are scored based on their performance. Since there is a link between a student\u2019s well-being and how they perform at school, many students have experienced a decline in their grades."}, {"text": "According to a survey done by OnceClass, an educational company that provides virtual access to study resources, about 85 percent of respondents said the pandemic had a negative effect on their performance."}, {"text": "According to Betheny Gross, an associate director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education and a contributor to the 74 Million Press, in St. Paul Minnesota, about 40 percent of high school students failed their first semester this year. For many students, the grades they\u2019re receiving during the pandemic aren\u2019t reflective of their effort and don\u2019t take into consideration the challenges the pandemic has had on them. This shows that, in many cases, grades do not authentically reflect a student\u2019s mastery in a subject during a time of unprecedented stress, loss, fear and sickness."}, {"text": "According to a survey by the New York Times on ways to improve the school system, some students are in favor of eliminating standardized tests because it only leads to stress and memorizing facts they will soon forget.

Schools should also focus on real-world skills. According to Ms. Reilly these include applications, retrospection and self-reflection. These are necessary skills so students feel more engaged in the learning process."}, {"text": "Above all, schools should depict success in different ways since the narrative that grades are crucial for the future teaches students that if you don\u2019t have good grades, you won\u2019t be successful."}, {"text": "\u201cThere are so many different ways that people get to where they are meant to be, notwithstanding their grades,\u201d said Ms. Reilly. \u201cThe first step is to acknowledge the reality that the narrative is more false than true. In terms of education, the question becomes \u2018What are we showing students about what success means? Are we being clear about the bumps in the road and how to overcome them?\u2019 Or how a bump in the road is actually may be a door of opportunity.\u201d"}], "file_structural_elements": {"title": "Pandemic reveals flaws in grading system", "date": "May 15, 2021", "writer": {"l7VmOCUaYoPYE1PNDIbH": {"name": "Shivani Sadasivam", "year": "2020"}}, "description": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Letter grades, school for six hours a day and tests: this is the American school system.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because of the ongoing pandemic, this school year students are learning in either virtual or hybrid classes.
