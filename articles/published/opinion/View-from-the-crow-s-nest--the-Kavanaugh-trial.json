There also seems to be an imbalance in attention to the credibility of one\u2019s reputation against another. Kavanaugh used his academic history, graduate of Yale College and Yale Law School, \u00a0and qualifications for Supreme Court Justice as points toward gaining credibility. Meanwhile, Ford\u2019s qualifications were disregarded."}, {"text": "Ford is an American professor of psychology at Palo Alto University and a research psychologist at Stanford University School of Medicine. Although she holds a prestigious and respected academic reputation, she was repeatedly mocked and threatened by critics for giving her testimony in an attempt to discredit her story. People believed she was making the story solely to bring down Kavanaugh."}, {"text": "This uninformed generalization sparked the spread of the #HimToo tag on social media, a counterprotest to the #MeToo movement.

After Ford came forward with her allegations, she received multiple death threats, which forced her to keep her sons at a friends home for their safety. This reaction to her allegation seems like it would be discouraging for victims of sexual assault to finally get justice or close that chapter of their life."}, {"text": "Interestingly, Ford\u2019s bravery paved the way for others to address their experience. RAINN , a national sexual assault hotline, saw a 38 percent increase in hotline traffic from the day of Ford\u2019s testimony on Thursday through the end of the week."}, {"text": "What this shows is the lasting impact that the #MeToo movement has had on people\u2019s, especially women\u2019s, attitudes towards sexual assault.
