This has, however, blinded us to the discrimination that black students face."}, {"text": "The culture of the student body is fundamentally flawed, as highlighted by recent inappropriate social media videos posted by a student. Although the school district took swift action in addressing the incident, we must ensure that it does not occur again. As students of South, we believe that our school \u2014 as an institution of learning \u2014 has an undeniable responsibility to educate its students, taking the first step toward fighting systems of oppression."}, {"text": "The recent murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and others have shocked our society and called us to dismantle the entrenched systemic racism that oppresses so many people in this country. High School South must be part of this movement. The school district is obligated to educate students on issues of oppression and systemic racism and to foster a culture of antiracism. We believe there are five actions, as detailed below, that we as a school can take towards accomplishing this task."}, {"text": "First, we encourage High School South students to make a commitment to reading Ibram X. Kendi\u2019s book How To Be an Antiracist over the summer. Kendi is one of the leading scholars of race and discriminatory policy in America and a strong proponent of antiracism."}, {"text": "In his words, \u201cOne either allows racial inequities to persevere, as a racist, or confronts racial inequities, as an antiracist. There is no in-between safe space of \u2018not racist.\u2019\u201d If we are to commit to confronting racism as per Dr. Aderhold\u2019s letter, it is essential that we adopt this antiracist perspective; students must be provided the resources to do so on the individual level."}, {"text": "We suggest that while reading, students take notes, show evidence of discussion with a peer and prepare for further discussion at the start of the academic year. We believe that the school district should also provide an evolving database of resources \u2014 including but not limited to Kendi\u2019s \u201cStamped from the Beginning,\u201d Michelle Alexander\u2019s \u201cThe New Jim Crow,\u201d Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s \u201cBetween the World and Me,\u201d and James Baldwin\u2019s \u201cThe Fire Next Time\u201d \u2014 published on the district website and emailed to students and families to encourage further investigation and discussion."}, {"text": "Second, we believe that the establishment of an ally group or \u201cAntiracism Club\u201d would be invaluable to the school. Such a group would begin doing the work outlined in Kendi\u2019s book, applying the knowledge accrued over the summer. It would encourage student involvement in actionable antiracism and collaborate with the school\u2019s cultural clubs (i.e. the BSU, SAASA, KSU, JSU, Chinese Club and Hispanic Club) to support and amplify their voices."}, {"text": "This group would also be responsible for curating the school\u2019s antiracism database and running a social media account so as to be more accessible to students and the WWP community. The official formation of such a club would help create a space for safe discussion and show the school\u2019s commitment to antiracism."}, {"text": "Third, it is essential that the school district remain proactive toward issues of race in our school. It is not uncommon to hear racial slurs casually thrown around by students. This normalizes racism, allowing students to distance themselves from its viscerality while continuing to perpetuate it."}, {"text": "Even when a statement is intended as a joke, force of habit coupled with a culture of normalization means that such statements are thoughtlessly repeated. We feel that the school must make a conscious effort to dismantle this casual treatment of racism by holding school climate assemblies throughout the year where these issues are explicitly addressed."}, {"text": "Fourth, we feel that teachers must be equipped to address issues of race in the classroom. They are directly responsible for students\u2019 learning and must therefore be able to act as upstanding examples, teach accurate information in a sensitive manner and maintain safe, equitable spaces for students. To us, the best way to implement this is to include it in teacher training sessions and Professional Development days."}, {"text": "Lastly, it is our belief that the social studies curriculum needs to undergo revision. Black history is not to be saved for Martin Luther King Day, or February. The experience of black Americans is treated as the exception, when it is in fact American history and therefore essential to an equitable curriculum. In particular, the Reconstruction era unit \u2014 the study of which is crucial to understanding the 20th and 21st centuries \u2014 lacks in substance and depth. Additionally, there is no discussion or condemnation of previous discriminatory policy (e.g. the 3/5ths compromise), as it would supposedly undermine the principle of historical neutrality. However, neutrality is not an option when issues of human rights and injustice are concerned; encouraging students to understand different historical perspectives is not license to legitimize those perspectives."}, {"text": "We can not be passive, as James Baldwin writes in \u201cThe Fire Next Time\u201d: \u201cwe, with love, shall force our brothers to see themselves as they are, to cease fleeing from reality and begin to change it.\u201d"}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "Photo Courtesy Ms. Sima Kumar"}], "file_structural_elements": {"title": "Guest editorial: South Students Commit to Antiracism", "date": "June 19, 2020", "writer": {"": {"name": "Dean Lourenco", "year": ""}}, "description": "When my LA II Honors students began James Baldwin\u2019s The Fire Next Time in the second week of March, a student brought up Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s shooting during class discussion on Google Meet.\u00a0 By the time we finished Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s Between the World and Me after the Memorial Day holiday, the George Fl", "image": "https://thepirateseye.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200619_122705-900x506.jpg"}}
