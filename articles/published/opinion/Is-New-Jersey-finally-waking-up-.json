This lack of change is clearly evident \u00a0when these 2018 results are compared to the last New Jersey senate race in 2014."}, {"text": "Democratic candidate Cory Booker received 55.8 percent of the votes while Republican candidate Jeff Bell had 42.4 percent. Both elections were pretty close in numbers. Comparing the two Democratic candidates, Booker received only around 2 percent more votes than Menendez did, and Menendez is an indicted criminal.
