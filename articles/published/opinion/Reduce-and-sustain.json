Because of this, petroleum is easily exhausted without sustainable practices. What\u2019s more, plastic products are incredibly difficult to break down and can produce microplastics, according to environmental science teacher Jamie Roder. Microplastics are tiny plastic particles capable of accumulating in the environment and within organisms."}, {"text": "\u201cThis can build up and block their intestinal systems and prevent them from digesting,\u201d said Ms. Roder. \u201cThey can also fill up their stomachs and can cause a reduced feeling of hunger, they might not eat enough to survive. And then there is also the threat that there could be toxins in these plastics.\u201d"}, {"text": "The ban also covers paper bags, which many businesses in the paper industry argue is too strict. While more eco-friendly, paper has its share of drawbacks. Paper consumes more resources than plastic when produced: large amounts of land, water, and nutrients are consumed as trees are grown and deforested. The process of refining wood into paper consumes a great amount of energy, some from renewable sources like biofuel and hydroelectric energy, but some from fossil fuels that emit large quantities of greenhouse gasses. So cutting paper bags out entirely conserves a substantial amount of resources."}, {"text": "\u201cA huge amount of the water that we use is actually built into the products that we buy. And paper bags, especially since they depend on growing trees, will have a much higher water footprint than plastic bags,\u201d said Ms. Roder."}, {"text": "The financial concerns that many businesses have are justified. Cutting out convenient carryout bags will reduce the amount of product that shoppers can carry. But, these bags are still an expense that stores have to invest in, and prohibiting the distribution of carryout bags will actually be a substantial benefit in the long run for businesses that won\u2019t need to order batches of bags."}, {"text": "\u201cOver time, if we as a society get into the habit of bringing our own bags to grocery stores, it will ultimately lower costs because the grocery stores would simply not have to provide that anymore,\u201d said Ms. Roder. \u201cThe initial impact would be the greatest, but the stores will purposely have to adapt for the better of the environment.\u201d"}, {"text": "The purpose of this ban extends beyond monetary costs and profits. By bringing reusable bags during shopping excursions, citizens will be forming sustainable long term habits that decrease the use of plastic and paper, lessening the demand for their production and reducing the amount of garbage that would pile into landfills."}, {"text": "\u201cThis legislation helps create a mindset that plastic should stop being the easy \u2018go-to\u2019 solution,\u201d said junior Arushi Aggarwal. \u201cIt helps create awareness about the various alternatives and allows people to dive deeper into helping the environment as this ban is going to affect their daily lives.\u201d"}, {"text": "Bad habits are the toughest to break, but this bag ban is sure to make people think and encourage them to consider the environmental effects of their actions.
