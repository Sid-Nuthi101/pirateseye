But you can always ask a teacher for an extension or making due dates earlier or later depending on what works out for you. I\u2019ve tried asking teachers for extensions and some of them have agreed to that. As far as relaxing goes, try to manage your time as best you can and not cram everything into one day. Having your tasks spread through the week to make them more manageable. Make sure to also get sleep because it\u2019s the best type of relaxation. Take college applications seriously, but also don\u2019t overwork yourself.
